These norms are incorporated into national and international legal systems, which specify mechanisms and procedures to hold the duty-bearers accountable and provide redress for alleged victims of human rights violations.  After a brief discussion of the use of human rights in ethical, legal and advocacy discourse and some historical background of the concept of human rights, this essay will examine the tensions between human rights and state sovereignty, the challenges to the universality of human rights, the enumeration of rights recognized by the international community, and the means available to translate the high aspirations of human rights into practice. II. Human rights in ethics, law and social activism  There are numerous theoretical debates surrounding the origins, scope and significance of human rights in political

Roughly speaking, invoking the term “human rights” (which is often referred to as “human rights discourse” or “human rights talk”) is based on moral reasoning (ethical discourse), socially sanctioned norms (legal/political discourse) or social mobilization (advocacy discourse). These three types of discourse are by no means alternative or sequential but are all used in different contexts, depending on who is invoking human rights discourse, to whom they are addressing their claims, and what they expect to gain by doing so. The three types of discourse are inter-related in the sense that public reasoning based on ethical arguments and social mobilization based on advocacy agendas influence legal norms, processes and institutions and thus all three modes of discourse contribute to human rights becoming part of social reality. A. Human rights as ethical concerns  Human rights have in common an ethical concern for just treatment, built on empathy or altruism in human behavior and concepts of justice in philosophy. The philosopher and economist, Amartya Sen, considers that “Human rights can be seen as primarily ethical demands… Like other ethical claims that demand acceptance, there is an implicit presumption in making pronouncements on human rights that the underlying ethical claims will survive open and informed scrutiny.”1  In moral reasoning, the expression “human rights” is often not distinguished from the more general concept of “rights,” although in law a “right” refers to any entitlement protected by law, the moral validity or legitimacy of which may be separate from its legal status as an entitlement. The moral basis of a right                                                 1 Amartya Sen, “Elements of a Theory of Human Rights,” Philosophy & Public Affairs, vol. 32, No. 4 (2004), p. 320. can draw on concepts such as natural law, social contract, justice as fairness, consequentialism and other theories of justice. In all these philosophical traditions, a right is conceived as an entitlement of individuals, either by virtue of being human or because they are members of a political community (citizens). In law, however, a right is any legally protected interest, whatever the social consequence of the enforcement of the right on the wellbeing of persons other than the right-holder (e.g., the property right of a landlord to evict a tenant, the right of a business to earn profits). To avoid confusion, it is helpful to use the term “human right” or its equivalent (“fundamental right,” “basic freedom,” “constitutional right”) to refer to a higher-order right, authoritatively defined and carrying the expectation that it has a peremptory character and thus prevails over other (ordinary) rights and reflects the essential values of the society adopting it.  Ethical and religious precepts determine what one is willing to accept as properly a human right. Such precepts are typically invoked in the debates over current issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, the death penalty, migration, much as they were around slavery and inequality based on class, gender or ethnicity in the past. Enlightenment philosophers derived the centrality of the individual from their theories of the state of nature. Social contractarians, especially Jean-Jacques Rousseau, predicated the authority of the state on its capacity to achieve the optimum enjoyment of natural rights, that is, of rights inherent in each individual irrespective of birth or status. He wrote in Essay on the Origin on Inequality Among Men that “it is plainly contrary to the law of nature…that the privileged few should gorge themselves with superfluities, while the starving multitude are in want of the bare necessities

The Enlightenment represents for the West both the affirmation of the scientific method with the related faith of human progress and the formulation of the human rights, which define the freedom and equality on which the legitimacy of modern governments have henceforth been judged. Karl Marx and much of socialist thinking questioned the “bourgeois” character of a limited interpretation of individual human rights and stressed community interests and egalitarian values.  The ethical basis of human rights has been defined using concepts such as human flourishing, dignity, duties to family and society, natural rights, individual freedom, and social justice against exploitation based on sex, class or caste. All of these moral arguments for human rights are part of ethical discourse. The tension between political liberalism and democratic egalitarianism, between Locke and Rousseau, between liberty and equality, between civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, have been part of the philosophical and political ambiguity of human rights since the beginning of the modern era.  Whether human rights discourse is essentially ethical and philosophical or rather essentially legal and political is a matter of dispute. Sen writes, “Even though human rights can, and often do, inspire legislation, this is a further fact, rather than                                                 2 D.G.H. Cole translation, p. 117. an constitutive characteristic of human rights”3, implying an inherent value of the concept of human rights, independent of what is established in law. Legal positivists would disagree and consider law to be constitutive rather than declarative of human rights. B. Human rights as legal rights (positive law tradition) “Legal positivists” regard human rights as resulting from a formal norm-creating process, by which we mean an authoritative formulation of the rules by which a society (national or international) is governed. While “natural rights” derive from natural order or divine origin, and are inalienable, immutable, and absolute, rights based on “positive law” are recognized through a political and legal process that results in a declaration, law, treaty, or other normative instrument. These may vary over time and be subject to derogations or limitations designed to optimize respect for human rights rather than impose an absolute standard. They become part of the social order when an authoritative body proclaims them, and they attain a higher degree of universality based on the participation of virtually every nation in the norm-creating process, a process that is law-based but that reflects compromise and historical shifts. Think of the moral and legal acceptability of slavery, torture, or sexual and racial discrimination over most of human history. The product of what has survived “open and informed scrutiny” (Sen’s expression) is thus often found not in journals and seminars on ethics and normative theory but rather at the end of the political or legislative process leading to the adoption of laws and treaties relating to human rights, such as the relatively recent abolition of slavery, torture                                                 3 Sen, supra, note 1, p. 319

The “International Bill of Human Rights” (consisting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR] of 1948, and two legally-binding treaties opened for signature in 1966, namely, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), along with the other human rights treaties of the United Nations (UN) and of regional organizations, constitute the primary sources and reference points for what properly belongs in the category of human rights. These legally recognized human rights are discussed below in Part IV.B. C. Human rights as social claims Before they are written into legal texts, human rights often emerge from claims of people suffering injustice and thus are based on moral sentiment, culturally determined by contextualized moral and religious belief systems. Revolt against tyranny is an ancient tradition. A modern precursor of social mobilization for human rights at the national level was the response to the unjust condemnation of Captain Dreyfus in 1894 as a spy for the Germans, which led Emile Zola to proclaim in his famous “J’Accuse…!”, an impassioned call to action that led to the creation of the Ligue française des droits de l’homme in 1897, and numerous similar leagues, which became federated in 1922 into the International Federation of Leagues for the Rights of Man (now the International Federation for Human Rights), which spawned its counterpart in the US in 1942, the International League for the Rights of Man, now functioning in New York as the International League for Human Rights.  Amnesty International (founded in 1961), the Moscow Human Rights Committee (founded in 1970), and Helsinki Watch (founded in 1978 and expanded into Human Rights Watch in 1988) were among the more effective non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Latin America, Africa and Asia saw the creation of an extraordinary array of human rights groups in the 1980s and 1990s, which have proliferated after the end of the Cold War. These NGOs emerged as social movements catalyzed by outrage at the mistreatment of prisoners, the exploitation of workers, the exclusion of women, children, persons with disabilities, or as part of struggles against slavery, the caste system, colonialism, apartheid, or predatory globalization. Such movements for social change often invoke human rights as the basis of their advocacy. If the prevailing theories of moral philosophy or the extant codes of human rights do not address their concerns, their action is directed at changing the theory and the legal formulations. NGOs not only contributed to the drafting of the UDHR but also in bringing down Apartheid,4 transforming the political and legal configuration of East-Central Europe5 and restoring democracy in Latin America.6 New norms emerged as a result of such social mobilization during the second half of the twentieth century regarding self-determination of peoples, prevention and punishment of torture, protection of vulnerable groups and, more recently, equal treatment of sexual minorities and protection of migrants.  The appeal to human rights in this advocacy discourse is no less legitimate than the legal and philosophical modes of discourse and is often the inspiration for the latter. Quoting Sen again, “The invoking of                                                 4 William Korey, NGOs and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: A Curious Grapevine, pp. 7-8. 5 Id., pp. 95-116. 6 Id., pp. 229-247.

(1) The idea of human rights having been thought, it cannot be unthought. It will not be replaced, unless by some idea which contains and surpasses it. (2) There are tenacious individuals and non-statal societies whose activity on behalf of the idea of human rights is not part of international relations but is part of a new process of international reality-forming.”8 He adds, “The idea of human rights should intimidate governments or it is worth nothing. If the idea of human rights reassures governments, it is worse than nothing.”9 In sum, the force of social movements drawing inspiration from human rights not only enriches the concept of human rights but also contributes to altering international society. III: Historical milestones  The historical context of human rights can be seen from a wide range of perspectives. At the risk of oversimplification, I will mention four approaches to the history of human rights.  The first approach traces the deeper                                                 7 Sen, supra, note 1, p. 317. 8 Philip Allott, Eunomia: New Order for a New World, Oxford University Press, 1990, p. 287. 9 Id. origins to ancient religious and philosophical concepts of compassion, charity, justice, individual worth, and respect for all life found in Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity and Islam. Precursors of human rights declarations are found in the ancient codes of Hammurabi in Babylon (about 1772 BCE), the Charter of Cyrus the Great in Persia (about 535 BCE), edicts of Ashoka in India (about 250 BCE), and rules and traditions of pre-colonial Africa and pre-Columbian America.10   Others trace modern human rights to the emergence of natural law theories in Ancient Greece and Rome and Christian theology of the Middle Ages, culminating in the rebellions in the 17th and 18th century Europe, the philosophers of the Enlightenment and the Declarations that launched the French and American revolutions, combined with the 19th century abolitionist, workers’ rights and women’s suffrage movements.11  A third trend is to trace human rights to their enthronement in the United Nations Charter of 1945, in reaction to the Holocaust and drawing on President Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms and the impact of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 on subsequent national constitutions and foreign policy and international treaties and                                                 10 Micheline Ishay, The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era, With a New Preface, New York: Norton and Co., 2008.

Lynn Hunt, in an essay on “The Revolutionary Origins of Human Rights,” affirms that: 
 Most debates about rights originated in the eighteenth century, and nowhere were discussions of them more explicit, more divisive, or more influential than in revolutionary France in the 1790s.  The answers given then to most fundamental questions about rights remained relevant throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  The framers of the UN declaration of 1948 closely followed the model established by the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789, while substituting “human” for the more                                                 12 Paul Gordon Lauren, The Evolution of International Human Rights: Visions Seen, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1998; Hersch Lauterpacht, International Law and Human Rights, with an introduction by Isidore Silver.

 Commenting on the French Revolution’s break with the past, Jürgen Habermas wrote that this “revolutionary consciousness gave birth to a new mentality, which was shaped by a new time consciousness, a new concept of political practice, and a new notion of legitimization.”15  Although it took more than a century after the French Revolution for this new mentality to include women and people subjected to slavery, the awareness that the “rights of man” should extend to all human beings was forcefully argued in the same period by Mary Wollstonecreaft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman 16 and by the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, founded in 1783. The valuation of every individual through natural rights was a break with the earlier determination of rights and duties on the basis of hierarchy and status. Concepts of human progress and human rights advanced in the 19th century, when capitalism and the industrial revolution transformed the global economy and generated immense wealth at the expense of colonized peoples and oppressed workers. Human rights advanced but mainly for propertied males in Western societies. Since the 19th century, the human rights of former colonialized peoples, women,                                                 14 Lynn Hunt, ed., The French Revolution and Human Rights.

The Second World War was the defining event for the internationalization of human rights. In 1940, H.G. Wells wrote The Rights of Man or What are We Fighting For?; Roosevelt announced the “four freedoms” (freedoms of speech and worship and freedoms from want and fear) in his 1941 State of the Union address; the UN Charter established in 1945 an obligation of all members to respect and observe human rights and created a permanent commission to promote their realization; the trial of Nazi doctors defined principles of bioethics that were codified in the Nuremberg Code in 1946; and the Nuremberg Trials, in 1945–46, of 24 of the most important captured leaders of Nazi Germany, established individual criminal responsibility for mass human rights violations. Each of these events connected with World War II has had major repercussions for human rights today. In the War’s immediate aftermath, bedrock human rights texts were adopted: the Genocide Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the Geneva Conventions in 1949 on the protection of victims of armed conflict, followed in 1966 by the International Covenants on Human Rights and scores of UN and regional human rights texts on issues such as torture, the rights of the child, minorities, discrimination against women, and disability rights, along with the creation of investigative and accountability procedures at the intergovernmental level. Individual criminal responsibility for mass violations of human rights re-emerged—after the hiatus of the Cold War—in the ad hoc tribunals on Rwanda and former Yugoslavia and finally in the International Criminal Court.   IV: Tensions and controversies about human rights today  To understand how human rights are part of the global agenda, we need to ask (A) why states even accept the idea of human rights obligations when they are supposed to be sovereign and therefore do what they want within their territory. Then we will explore (B) what is the current list of human rights generally accepted, before asking (C) whether they correspond to the basic values of all societies or are imposed from the outside for ideological reasons. Finally, we will examine (D) how they are transformed from word to deed, from aspiration to practice. A. Why do sovereign states accept human rights obligations? The principle of state sovereignty means that neither another state nor an international organization can intervene in a state’s action to adopt, interpret and enforce its laws within its jurisdiction. Does this principle of non-intervention in domestic affairs of states mean that they are free to violate human rights? Along with the principle of non-intervention, upon joining the United Nations, states have pledged themselves “to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55,”17 which include the promotion of “universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.”18                                                   17 Article 56 of the UN Charter. 18 Article 55 of the UN Charter. Article 1(3) of the

How that balance is interpreted varies according to theories of international relations. For those of the realist school (a theory that focuses on governments as autonomous and sovereign actors in international affairs, pursuing their national interests through the projection of economic, military and political power, without constraints of any superior authority or global government), only weak countries are under any constraint to allow international scrutiny of their human rights performance. For the liberal internationalist, global institutions and values, like human rights, matter more, although the international system is still based on state sovereignty. Theories of functionalism attach importance to gradual political federation, beginning with economic and social cooperation, especially through regional organizations. As these networks of interdependence grow, sovereign authority shifts to international institutions. Under the constructivist theory of international relations, ideas, such as human rights, define international structure, which in turn defines the interests and identities of states. Thus, social norms like human rights, rather than national security, can shape and progressively change foreign policy. In sum, as Richard Falk and others argue, absolute sovereignty has given way to the conception of “responsible sovereignty,” according to which sovereignty is conditional upon the state’s demonstrable adherence to minimum human rights standards and capacity to protect its citizens.19                                                                        Charter also includes “international co-operation…in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights” among the purposes of the UN. 19 Richard A. Falk, Human Rights Horizons: The Pursuit of Justice in a Globalizing World, New York: These realist, liberal internationalist, functionalist, and constructivist theories run along a continuum from state-centric approaches at one end (where national interests prevail over any appeal to universal human rights), to cosmopolitanism at the other end (where identity with and support for equal rights for all people should hold state sovereignty in check). In practice, states have accepted obligations to respect and promote human rights under the UN Charter and various human rights treaties, whatever their motivations, and, as a result, a regime has emerged in which human rights have progressively become part of the accepted standards of state behavior, functioning effectively in some areas and less so in others. In order to understand this phenomenon, it is useful to examine the current set of recognized human rights standards. B. How do we know which rights are recognized as human rights? While it is legitimate to draw on philosophical arguments or activist agendas to claim any global social issue as a human right, it is also useful to identify which rights are officially recognized as such. The most reliable source of the core content of international human rights is found in the International Bill of Human Rights, which enumerates approximately fifty normative propositions on which additional human rights documents have built. Scores of regional and UN treaties have expanded the scope of recognized human rights, including in specialized areas such as protection of victims of armed conflict, workers, refugees and displaced persons, and persons with                                                                        Routledge, 2001, p. 69.

The International Bill of Human Rights enumerates five group rights, twenty-four civil and political rights (CPR), and fourteen economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR). It also sets out seven principles that explain how the rights should be applied and interpreted. The group rights listed in the International Bill of Human Rights include two rights of peoples (self-determination and permanent sovereignty over natural resources) and three rights of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities (namely, the rights to enjoy one’s own culture, to practice one’s own religion, and to use one’s language).  The civil and political rights include five relating to physical integrity (rights to life; freedom from torture; freedom from slavery; freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention; and the right to humane treatment under detention).  Five other rights relate to the individual’s autonomy of thought and action (namely, freedom of movement and residence; prohibition of expulsion of aliens; freedom of thought, conscience and religious belief; freedom of expression; and the right to privacy). Another four rights concern the administration of justice (non-imprisonment for debt; fair trial—for which 16 additional rights are enumerated—; the right to personhood under the law; and the right to equality before the law). Six other civil & political rights relate to participation in civil society (freedom of assembly; freedom of association; the right to marry and found a family; rights of children; the right to practice a religion; and—as an exception to free speech—the prohibition of war propaganda and hate speech constituting incitement). The final sub-set of these rights is the four relating to political participation (namely, the right to hold public office; to vote in free elections; to be elected to office; and to equal access to public service). The economic, social and cultural rights reaffirmed in the International Bill of Human Rights include four workers’ rights (the right to gain a living by work freely chosen and accepted; the right to just and favorable conditions of work; the right to form and join trade unions; and the right to strike). Four others concern social protection (social security; assistance to the family, mothers and children; adequate standard of living, including food, clothing and housing; and the highest attainable level of physical and mental health). The remaining rights are the six concerning education and culture (the right to education directed towards the full development of the human personality; free and compulsory primary education; availability of other levels of education; participation in cultural life; protection of moral and material rights of creators and transmitters of culture, and the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress).  These rights are summarized in Table 1 below:    Table 1: List of human rights  Group Rights 1. Right to self-determination 2. Permanent sovereignty over natural resources 3.

The International Bill also specifies that (6) human rights may be subject to limitations and derogations and that (7) the rights in the Covenants may not be used as a pretext for lowering an existing standard if there is a higher one under national law.  In addition to the traditional grouping of human rights in the two major categories of human rights (CPR and ESCR), a third category of “solidarity rights” or “third generation rights” is sometimes invoked, including the rights to development, to a clean environment, and to humanitarian assistance). The reasons for separating CPR from ESCR have been questioned.20  For example, it is often claimed that CPR are absolute and immutable, whereas ESCR are relative and responsive to changing conditions. However, all rights are                                                 20 See Stephen P, Marks, “The Past and Future of the Separation of Human Rights into Categories,” Maryland Journal of International Law, vol. 24 (2009), pp. 208-241.

Consider, for example, that torture was an accepted means of obtaining a confession, that slavery was widely practiced and accepted for centuries, and that women were treated as chattel in many societies and only received political rights in the last century. Thus, these CPR have not been permanent features of society. It is also argued that CPR are to be implemented by states immediately, may be enforced through judicial remedies, and are relatively cost-free since they merely require the state to leave people alone (so-called “negative rights”), whereas ESCR should be implemented progressively, in accordance with available resources, since they require state expenditure (so-called “positive rights”) and are not suitable for lawsuits (“non-justiciable”). In many circumstances this is true; however, many ESCR have been made “justiciable” (that is, people can sue the state if they consider that the right has not been respected), and many CPR are not achieved merely passively but require a considerable investment of time and resources (for example, to train law enforcement officials or establish an independent judiciary).  Another reason they are often considered different in nature concerns denunciation of violations, which is often considered appropriate for CPR but should be avoided for ESCR in favor of a more cooperative approach to urge governments to do all they should to realize these rights. However, many situations arise where an accusatory approach for dealing with CPR is counter-productive and where it is appropriate to refer to violations of ESCR.  So these two categories—which the UN regards as inter-related and equally important—are not watertight and reasons for considering them inherently different may be challenged. In practice, the context dictates the most effective use of resources, institutions, and approaches more than the nature of the theoretical category of rights.  C. Are human rights the same for everyone? The claim that human rights are universal holds that they are the same for everyone because they are inherent in human beings by virtue of all people being human, and that human rights therefore derive from nature (hence the term “natural rights”). The UDHR refers to “the inherent dignity and … equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family [as] the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.” The American Declaration of Independence proclaims that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” and the French Declaration of 1789 refers to the “natural, unalienable, and sacred rights of man.” Another basis for saying that human rights are universal is to rely on their formal adoption by virtually all countries that have endorsed the UDHR or have ratified human rights treaties. Cultural relativists claim that human rights are based on values that are determined culturally and vary from one society to another, rather than being universal.21 There are several variants of this position. One is the so-called “Asian values” argument, according to which human rights                                                 21 See Terence Turner and Carole Nagengast (eds.), Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 53, No. 3 (special issue on human rights) (Autumn 1997).

The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.

To understand fully the challenge such contextualization represents we need to examine the means and methods through which universally accepted human rights are put into practice. D. How are human rights put into practice? Human rights are traditionally studied in a global context through (1) the norm-creating processes, which result in global human rights standards and (2) the norm-enforcement processes, which seek to translate laudable goals into tangible practices. In addition, there are (3) continuing and new challenges to the effectiveness of this normative regime. 1. The norm-creating process The norm-creating process refers to authoritative decision-making that results in the formal acknowledgement of specific rights and obligations in a given society and clarifies what is expected to realize the rights in practice. The typical norm-creating process in international human rights regarding a social issue begins with expression of concern by a delegate at a meeting of a political body and lobbying for co-sponsors to a resolution, which is                                                 27 United Nations, World Conference on Human Rights.  The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.  June 1993, para. 5. eventually adopted by that body. Once the issue is on the agenda, a political body may then commission a study, eventually leading to drafting a declaration, and then a convention, which has to be ratified and enter into force and is possibly followed by the adoption of an optional protocol providing for complaints procedures. All the major human rights issues, such as torture, women’s rights, racial discrimination, disappearances, rights of children and of persons with disabilities, went through these phases, lasting from ten to thirty years or more. This is how the body of human rights norms has expanded considerably from the International Bill of Human Rights to the current array of several hundred global and regional treaties. Following a related process, war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, have been addressed by other treaties calling for criminal prosecutions of perpetrators. The process can be summarized in Table 2: Table 2: Norm-creating process Lobbying for a resolution by NGOs and a limited number of government delegations Adoption of a resolution calling for a study Completion of a study Adoption of a resolution calling for a declaration Drafting and adoption of a declaration Adoption of a resolution calling for a convention Drafting and adoption of a convention Ratification and entry into force of the convention Setting up of treaty-monitoring body which issues interpretations of obligations Resolution calling for an optional protocol (OP) allowing for complaints Drafting and adoption of an OP Ratification and entry into force of the OP Treaty body passing judgment on complaints

In the domestic legal system, law is binding and the courts and the police use force to compel compliance. In the international human rights regime, law is not treated in quite the same way. The term “enforcement,” for example, refers to coerced compliance, which is rare, while most efforts focus on “implementation”, that is, as wide range of supervision, monitoring and general efforts to make duty-holders accountable.  Implementation is further subdivided into promotion (i.e., preventive measures that seek to ensure respect for human rights in the future) and protection (i.e., responses to violations that have occurred in the past or are ongoing). The means and methods of implementation may be summarized in three forms of promotion and five forms of protection.  Promotion of human rights is achieved through developing awareness, standard-setting and interpretation, and creation of national institutions. Awareness of human rights is a precondition to acting on them and is advanced though dissemination of knowledge (e.g., publications, information campaigns) and human rights education at all levels. Second is standard-setting, the drafting of human rights texts, in which the UN Commission on Human Rights, established in 1946, played a central role until it was replaced in 2006 by the Human Rights Council. Numerous other bodies in the UN system, such as the Commission on the Status of Women, and UN Specialized Agencies (such as the International Labour Organization and UNESCO), as well as the regional organizations (Council of Europe, Organization of American States, African Union, League of Arab States, Association of Southeast Asian Nations) adopt and monitor other international human rights texts. The third preventive or promotional means of implementation is national institution building, which includes improvements in the judiciary and law enforcement institutions and the creation of specialized bodies such as national commissions for human rights and offices of an ombudsman. The protection of human rights involves a complex web of national and international mechanisms to monitor, judge, urge, denounce, and coerce states, as well as to provide relief to victims. Monitoring compliance with international standards is carried out through the reporting and complaints procedures of the UN treaty bodies and regional human rights commissions and courts.  States are required to submit reports and the monitoring body—often guided by information provided by NGOs—which examines progress and problems with a view to guiding the reporting country to do better. The Human Rights Council also carries out a Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of all countries, regardless of treaty ratification. Several optional procedures allow individuals and groups (and sometimes other states) to petition these bodies for a determination of violations. The quasi-judicial bodies (such as the Human Rights Committee or the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights) utilize various forms of fact-finding and investigation and issue their views so that governments can take action to live up to their human rights obligations.   “Special procedures” refer to UN working groups, independent experts and special rapporteurs or representatives mandated to study countries or issues, including taking on cases of alleged violations, going on mission to countries and

The “thematic” rapporteurs are specifically mandated to study issues such as forced disappearances, summary executions, torture, toxic waste, and the rights to health, adequate food and housing.  As of 2015 there were some 41 “thematic mandates”. In addition, there were 14 “country mandates” covering Belarus, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Haiti, Islamic Republic of Iran, Mali, Myanmar, Palestinian Territories, Somalia, Sudan and Syrian Arab Republic. The second means of protection is adjudication of cases by fully empowered courts, the main international ones being the International Court of Justice (which can only decide cases between states that agree to submit their dispute to the Court), the International Criminal Court (which can try individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression), as well as the regional courts, namely, the European Court of Human Rights (open to persons within the 47 member states of the Council of Europe); the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (open to the 25 states parties—23 active parties—to the American Convention on Human Rights); and the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (open to the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, individuals and accredited NGOs from those of the 54 African Union members that have ratified the protocol establishing the Court, numbering 30 in 2016). Political supervision refers to the acts of influential bodies made up of representatives of states, including resolutions judging the policies and practices of states.  The UN Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the Assembly of the Organization of American States, all have adopted politically significant resolutions denouncing governments for violations of human rights and demanding that they redress the situation and often that they provide compensation to the victims. Parliamentary Commissions and National Human Rights Commissions, as well as local and international NGOs, also follow-up their investigations with firmly worded and politically significant demands for change. This form of sanction may appear toothless since it is not backed up with coercive force; nevertheless, in practice many governments take quite seriously the pronouncements of such bodies and go to considerable lengths to avoid such political “naming and shaming,” including by improving their human rights performance.   The seventh means of responding to human rights violations is through humanitarian relief or assistance. Provision of food, blankets, tents, medical services, sanitary assistance, and other forms of aid save lives and improve health of persons forcibly displaced, often as a result of large-scale human rights violations.  Refugees and internally displaced persons come under the protection of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which deploys massive amounts of aid, along with the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other agencies, as well as major NGOs like Oxfam, Care, and the International Rescue Committee.

Human rights considerations were part of the use of Chapter VII in Cambodia, Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq and other locations.28 This forceful means of protecting human rights is complex and can have harmful health consequences, as has been the case with sanctions imposed on Haiti and Iraq in the 1990s. If used properly, Chapter VII action can be the basis for implementing the “Responsibility to Protect”, a doctrine adopted at a 2005 UN Summit that reaffirms the international community’s role to prevent and stop genocides, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity when a national government fails to do so.29 The responsibility to protect (R2P) was explicitly referred to in Security Council Resolutions concerning the Great Lakes region, Sudan, Libya, Côte d’Ivoire, Yemen, Mali, South Sudan, Central African Republic, and                                                 28 See Bertrand G.

Syria,30 but only in Darfur31 and Libya32 was it used to authorize enforcement action. The way R2P was applied in Libya explains in part the reluctance to use it for enforcement action in the civil war in Syria.33  These eight means and methods of implementation are summarized in Table 3 below. 3. Continuing and new challenges to human rights realization The adoption of norms and the implementation of accountability procedures are not enough to eliminate the deeper causes of human rights deprivation. The most salient challenges to the effectiveness of human rights at the global level relate to the reliance on the state to take responsibility for correcting its ways; structural issues of the global economy favoring the maximization of profits in ways over which human rights machinery has little or no control or impact; and cultural conditions based on patriarchy, class, caste and ethnicity, which only change slowly over time as power relations and mentalities change. In all these arenas, human rights are highly political: to the extent that they are                                                 30	  For references to Responsibility to Protect (RtoP or R2P) in Security Council Resolutions, see http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/component/content/article/136-latest-news/5221--references-to-the-responsibility-to-protect-in-security-council-resolutions (accessed 25 Apr 2014).	  31	  Security Council Resolution 1706 of 31 August 2006.	  32	  Security Council Resolution 1970 of 26 February 2011, and Security Council Resolution 1973 of 17 March 2011.	  33	  See Spencer Zifcak, “The Responsibility to Protect after Libya and Syria,” Melbourne Journal of  International Law, vol. 13, (2012), pp. 2-35.

At the same time, they offer a normative framework for individuals and collectivities to organize for change, so that state legitimacy is measured by human rights performance, the political economy is freed from gross economic disparities and social inequities, and cultural identity is preserved and cherished in ways that are consistent with prevailing values of individual autonomy and freedom. Appeals to human rights in bringing about such change is usually supported, at least rhetorically, by the community of nations and, in progressively more meaningful and effective ways, by networks of solidarity that have profoundly changed societies in the past. That is how practices such as slavery, apartheid, colonialism, and exclusions of all sorts have been largely eliminated. Similarly, environmental degradation, poverty, terrorism, non-representative government, discrimination based on sexual orientation and an expanding array of other challenges in the 21st century will continue to test the value of human rights as a normative and institutional guide to policy and practice.

All three overlap, although historically people have risen up against injustices for millennia and made respect for dignity integral to ethical and religious thinking, whereas the enumeration of codes of universal human rights has a much shorter history, dating primarily from the 18th century and especially from the inaugural moment of the UDHR in making human rights an explicit feature of the post World War II international legal order. We have examined what “universal” means in a world of conflicting ideologies, religions, beliefs and values and reviewed the content of the normative propositions accepted as belonging to this category of “universal human rights,” while sounding a cautionary note about taking their separation into two major categories too literally. Finally, we examined the processes by which human rights norms are recognized and put into practice and referred to several challenges facing the 21st century.  In the coming decades, we can expect gaps to be filled in the institutional machinery of Africa and Asia, and in making ESCR genuinely equal in importance to CPR, as well as in the clarification of human rights standards in such areas as sexual orientation and advances in science and technology, while refining the means and methods of human rights promotion and protection. The essential value of human rights thinking and action, however, is unlikely to change: it has served and will continue to serve as a gauge of the legitimacy of government, a guide to setting the priorities for human progress, and a basis for consensus over what values can be shared across diverse ideologies and cultures.
