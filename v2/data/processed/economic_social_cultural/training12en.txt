INTRODUCTION
Human rights are a legal statement of what human beings require to live fully human
lives. Collectively they are a comprehensive, holistic statement. All human rights—civil,cultural, economic, political and social—are recognized as a universal, indivisible andinterdependent body of rights, as originally foreseen in the 1948 Universal Declarationof Human Rights.
1A comprehensive approach to the promotion and protection of
human rights, which include economic, social and cultural rights, ensures that peopleare treated as full persons and that they may enjoy simultaneously all rights andfreedoms, and social justice.
The promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights
After an extended period of relative neglect, there have been important advances in the
field of economic, social and cultural rights in recent years. The Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993, wasan important milestone in this process, urging that “there must be a concerted effort toensure recognition of economic, social and cultural rights at the national, regional andinternational levels”.
2Attention to economic, social and cultural rights has increased
considerably, both within the United Nations and as a result of the incorporation of eco-nomic, social and cultural rights as legal norms in many national constitutions and legalsystems. 
However, when “a fifth of the developing world’s population goes hungry every night,
a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water, and a third livesin abject poverty—at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to de-scribe it” renewed attention and commitment to the full realization of economic, socialand cultural rights are vital.
3
National human rights institutions can play an important role in a concerted effort toaddress economic, social and cultural rights. In parallel with the increased importanceattached to these rights over the past decade, the numbers and effectiveness of nationalhuman rights institutions have also increased. In 1991, the first United Nations interna-tional workshop of national human rights institutions was held in Paris. There, the insti-tutions present drafted and adopted international minimum standards for effectivenational human rights institutions, the Principles relating to the Status of NationalInstitutions, known as the “Paris Principles” (see annex). These standards were endorsedin 1992 by the Commission on Human Rights and in 1993 by the General Assembly ofthe United Nations. In the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the WorldConference on Human Rights also reaffirmed the importance of national human rightsinstitutions, encouraging the enhancement of United Nations activities to assist Statesat their request in the establishment and strengthening of national human rights insti-tutions, and cooperation among national human rights institutions, regional organiza-tions and the United Nations. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights has responded to that recommendation and undertaken an extensiveprogramme of technical assistance and cooperation. The United Nations DevelopmentProgramme, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the International Organisation of the
vii1The Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines civil and political rights and economic, social and
cultural rights and was intended to be the precursor to a single human rights covenant. Political, ideologicaland other factors, however, precluded this and two International Covenants were eventually adopted—nearly two decades after the promulgation of the Universal Declaration.

3Human Development Report 1994, UNDP , New York, p. 2.
viiiFrancophonie, the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, the African Commission
on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the International Ombudsman Institute and interna-tional and regional civil society organizations have also become more active in promot-ing national human rights institutions. 
The increase in attention to economic, social and cultural rights by national human
rights institutions, however, has been uneven and sporadic. In many instances, nationalhuman rights institutions have been less active than many other institutions and organ-izations in relation to economic, social and cultural rights.
4Persistent false distinctions
between civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights, and lack ofunderstanding of the legal nature and content of economic, social and cultural rightshave undermined effective action on economic, social and cultural rights.
5
To a certain degree, the difficulty in fully realizing economic, social and cultural rightsin the face of endemic poverty in many countries and increasing inequality in wealthand income between and within States discourages action on economic, social and cul-tural rights when other challenges confront organizations. However, greater attentionis now being given to developing the capacity of national human rights institutions toincrease their activities for the promotion and protection of economic, social and cul-tural rights. This handbook has been produced to assist those efforts.
The role of national human rights institutions
Various international bodies and mechanisms have identified the important role 
national human rights institutions can play in protecting and promoting economic, social and cultural rights.
6Most notably, the Committee on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, in its General Comment No.10 on the role of national human rights institutions in the protection of economic, social and cultural rights (see annex), stressedthat national human rights institutions:
4In a recent report, the International Council on Human Rights Policy, for instance, was quite explicit in
pointing out the need for national human rights institutions to do more on economic, social and culturalrights. In this report, the Council recommended that national human rights institutions should addresseconomic, social and cultural rights. Poverty and unequal access to educational, housing and healthprovisions increasingly determine social progress and quality of life. National human rights institutionscannot meet the needs of vulnerable groups without addressing economic, social and cultural rights. Somedo so already, but many have yet to put resources into the implementation of these rights or take themseriously. New national human rights institutions should include economic, social and cultural rights in theirmandate. National institutions whose mandate does not already include economic, social and cultural rightsshould consider redrafting their mandate to do so. Practical strategies might include: identifying areas ofexclusion and developing policy proposals to deal with them; monitoring government policies in relation toeconomic, social and cultural rights; taking up cases that extend access to economic, social and culturalrights; and identifying ways of making economic, social and cultural rights justiciable. (International Councilon Human Rights Policy, Performance and Legitimacy: National Human Rights Institutions , Versoix,
Switzerland, 2000).
5These fallacies often centred on distinctions such as the purportedly positive versus the negative nature ofthe rights concerned, the allegedly cost-free nature of civil and political rights compared to the invariablyresource-intensive content of economic, social and cultural rights, the capacity of civil and political rights tobe implemented immediately and the purely progressive characteristics of economic, social and culturalrights, or the debate concerning the justiciable versus the non-justiciable nature of economic, social andcultural rights. Overcoming the falsehood of these arbitrary distinctions has been a major task of economic,social and cultural rights advocates for the past few decades—a task that has now in many respects beenovertaken by the need to improve measures of enforcement and implementation of these rights.
6The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its General Recommendation XVII on theestablishment of national institutions to facilitate implementation of the [International] Convention [on theElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination], recommended that States Parties to that Convention"establish national commissions or other appropriate bodies, taking into account, mutatis mutandis , the
principles relating to the status of national institutions annexed to Commission on Human Rights resolution1992/54 of 3 March 1992, to serve, inter alia, the following purposes: (a) to promote respect for theenjoyment of human rights without any discrimination, as expressly set out in article 5 of the InternationalConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination". Article 5 of that Convention reaffirmsa range of economic, social and cultural rights.
have a potentially crucial role to play in promoting and ensuring the indivisibility and interde-
pendence of all human rights. Unfortunately, this role has too often either not been accordedto the institution or has been neglected or given a low priority by it. It is therefore essentialthat full attention be given to economic, social and cultural rights in all of the relevant activ-ities of these institutions.
Similarly, the 1998 Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights (see annex) emphasize: 
Promotional and monitoring bodies, such as national ombudsman institutions and human
rights commissions, should address violations of economic, social and cultural rights as vigor-ously as they address violations of civil and political rights. (Guideline 25) 
Many national human rights institutions are increasingly aware of the need to protect
and promote economic, social and cultural rights.7Many human rights non-govern-
mental organizations and academic writers have urged that this protection and promo-tion be continued and furthered.
8The International Council on Human Rights Policy, for
example, in a March 2000 report on the performance and legitimacy of national humanrights institutions, recommended that “national human rights institutions should ad-dress economic, social and cultural rights” and suggested that they identify areas of ex-clusion and develop policy proposals to deal with those rights.
9
In July 2000, the Commonwealth Conference on National Human Rights Institutionsrecommended that:
national institutions, whether or not their enabling statutes and national constitutions recog-
nise economic, social and cultural rights as justiciable, should employ all available means todeal with the questions related to the advancement of economic, social and cultural rights.
10 
National human rights institutions have many functions in relation to the protection and
promotion of human rights, including handling complaints, undertaking investigations,monitoring the performance of obligations under human rights treaties, advising theState on the domestic application of international treaty obligations, recommendingpolicy changes and providing training and public education. They can exercise thesefunctions as effectively for the protection and promotion of economic, social and cul-tural rights as for civil and political rights. To give proper attention to economic, socialand cultural rights, however, national human rights institutions need a comprehensiveunderstanding of the legal nature of these rights and relevant State obligations underinternational and domestic law. They also need to explore the breadth of their man-dates, review their internal and external resources and address the challenges of imple-menting economic, social and cultural rights. 
ix07The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its concluding observations (E/C.12/1/Add.31
of 10 December 1998) on the third periodic report of Canada submitted under the International Covenanton Economic, Social and Cultural Rights welcomed the Canadian Human Rights Commission's statementabout the inadequate protection and enjoyment of economic and social rights in Canada and its proposalfor the inclusion of those rights in human rights legislation, as recommended by the Committee. TheCommittee also expressed concern that in both Ontario and Quebec, governments had adoptedlegislation to redirect social assistance payments directly to landlords without the consent of recipients,despite the fact that the Quebec Human Rights Commission and an Ontario human rights tribunal hadfound that treatment of social assistance recipients to be discriminatory.

xThe aim of the handbook
This handbook is intended to help national human rights institutions maximize the ef-
fectiveness of their functions and powers in addressing economic, social and culturalrights. Its aim is to assist national human rights institutions in the development of poli-cies, processes and skills to integrate economic, social and cultural rights further intotheir work, thereby enabling them to address poverty and development, for example,through an economic, social and cultural rights framework.
This handbook will discuss ways in which national human rights institutions can become
more effective in protecting and promoting economic, social and cultural rights. It willexamine how national institutions’ legal mandates can be interpreted to incorporateeconomic, social and cultural rights within their jurisdictions, how their functions andpowers can be exercised more appropriately in regard to these rights, how they can usetheir resources most efficiently and effectively and how they can implement economic,social and cultural rights in the political and social contexts in which they operate.
Although the handbook is directed specifically at the protection and promotion of eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights, many of its approaches are equally applicable to thework of national human rights institutions in relation to civil and political rights.
The intended audience for the handbook
The handbook is intended primarily for the members and staff of national human rights
institutions. However, it can also serve as a resource for those involved in the establish-ment of new national human rights institutions and for partners of existing national hu-man rights institutions that wish to support the incorporation of economic, social andcultural rights in the mandate and activities of these institutions.
How to use the handbook
The handbook is designed to be informative, widely applicable, globally relevant and
easy to use. Where possible, case studies and examples illustrate how national humanrights institutions have addressed economic, social and cultural rights. Key internationalinstruments are annexed to the handbook and a bibliography is also provided. Thehandbook could be adapted into a trainer’s guide for national human rights institutions.
The handbook has three main sections.
SECTION 1 seeks to deepen understanding of the legal nature of economic, social and
cultural rights and of State obligations to promote and protect them under internationaland domestic law.
SECTION 2 examines the important role national human rights institutions can play in
protecting and promoting economic, social and cultural rights through a fuller under-standing and interpretation of their mandate, powers and functions. It also outlineschallenges in addressing economic, social and cultural rights.
SECTION 3 focuses on practical strategies for national human rights institutions to work
effectively in the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights.
I. THE NATURE OF
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL RIGHTS
1
Economic, social and cultural rights are fully recognized in international human rights
law. Historically, these rights have received less attention than civil and political rights,but they are now being focused on increasingly. This section of the handbook discussesthe legal nature of these rights and of the obligations they impose on States. 
As will be discussed in the next section of the handbook, national human rights institu-
tions have important roles to play in protecting and promoting economic, social and cul-tural rights. To do so effectively, members and staff of national human rights institutionsneed to have a comprehensive understanding of the legal foundations of and State ob-ligations with regard to economic, social and cultural rights, as well as other features ofthese rights. This section introduces these issues, briefly examining the normative frame-work of economic, social and cultural rights and the legal obligations of States that haverecognized these rights.

3A. T HE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK
International human rights law recognizes economic, social and cultural rights as inte-
gral parts of the human rights framework. The key international texts explicitly refer-ring to economic, social and cultural rights are:
■Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948);
■International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination(1965);
■International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966);
■Declaration on Social Progress and Development (1969); 
■Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women(1979); 
■Declaration on the Right to Development (1986); 
■Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989);
■International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workersand Members of Their Families (1990).
11
In addition, many regional human rights instruments address economic, social and cul-tural rights, most notably:
■African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (1981); 
■Additional Protocol in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to theAmerican Convention on Human Rights (Protocol of San Salvador) (1988); 
■European Social Charter (revised 1996) and the Additional Protocol thereto. 
Economic, social and cultural rights are also widely recognized in domestic legal sys-
tems, although not to the same extent as civil and political rights. Dozens of nationalconstitutions, including those of South Africa, Finland and Portugal, explicitly recognizeeconomic, social and cultural rights as fully justiciable rights. Their protection and pro-motion are included as general State duties within the legal and policy spheres in manyother national constitutions, including those of India, the Netherlands and Mexico.Virtually all States have domestic statutes of one form or another that incorporate ele-ments of economic, social and cultural rights. The legal status of these rights, therefore,is not in doubt. Although few domestic legal systems incorporate all elements of everyeconomic, social and cultural right, the great majority of States have ratified interna-tional treaties recognizing these rights and have adopted national and local laws to giveeffect to them.
Human rights as a single body of law
Civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights are not fundamentally
different from one another, either in law or in practice. All rights are indivisible and interdependent.
11In addition, a large number of conventions and recommendations adopted by the International Labour
Organization (ILO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other inter-governmentalorganizations have established specific standards recognizing various economic, social and cultural rights.The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees also contains specific economic, social andcultural rights for refugees.
412One of the central reaffirmations of the equal nature of these two sets of rights is to be found in United
Nations General Assembly resolution 32/130 of 16 December 1977, which asserts that (a) all human rightsand fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent; equal attention and urgent considerationshould be given to the implementation, promotion and protection of both civil and political, andeconomic, social and cultural rights; (b) the full realization of civil and political rights without theenjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights is impossible; (c) the achievement of lasting progress inthe implementation of human rights is dependent upon sound and effective national and internationalpolicies of economic and social development.
13Under the European Convention on Human Rights, the Airey case is perhaps most often cited in this
respect: "Whilst the Convention sets forth what are essentially civil and political rights, many of them haveimplications of a social or economic nature. The [European] Court [of Human Rights] therefore considers,like the Commission, that the mere fact than an interpretation of the Convention may extend into thesphere of social and economic rights should not be a decisive factor against such an interpretation; thereis no watertight division separating that sphere from the field covered by the Convention". (Eur. Ct. H.R.,Airey judgement (9 October 1979), Series A, No. 32, p. 15, para. 26). See also, the 1986 cases of
Feldbrugge v. the Netherlands (Eur. Ct. H.R. Series A, No. 99, 8 EHRR 425) and Deumeland v. Germany
(Eur. Ct. H.R. Series A, No. 100, 8 EHRR 448) that determined that certain forms of social security benefitsare covered by the civil rights and obligations clause of article 6 (1) and are thus justiciable at the domesticlevel. With respect to the application of such doctrines to the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights, see the cases of Broeks v the Netherlands (Comm. No. 172/1984), United Nations document
CCPR/C/29/D/172/1984 of 16 April 1987; L.G. Danning v. the Netherlands (Comm. No. 180/1984) United
Nations document CCPR/C/29/D/180/1984 of 16 April 1987; and Zwaan de Vries v. the Netherlands
(Comm. No. 182/1984), United Nations document CCPR/C/29/D/182/1984 of 16 April 1987, asconsidered by the Human Rights Committee.

the International Covenants on Human Rights" in Osgoode Hall Law Journal , vol. 27, No. 4, 1989; see in
particular pp. 851-878.ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS STANDARDS
1. The indivisibility and interdependence of all rights
The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights – civil, cultural,
economic, political and social – are fundamental tenets of international humanrights law, repeatedly reaffirmed, perhaps most notably at the 1993 WorldConference on Human Rights.
12
This has not always been the case. Indeed, human rights advocates had to devoteimmense efforts to achieve the normative and the practical recognition of theinterdependence of rights. Indivisibility and interdependence are central principlesof human rights, as are the inherent dignity of the human being, participation andgender equity.
The indivisible and interdependent nature of all human rights means that
economic, social and cultural rights apply to all individuals on the basis of equalityand without discrimination, that they create specific governmental obligations,that they are justiciable and that they can and should be claimed.
All rights need to be treated as equal by national human rights institutions in their
efforts to promote and protect human rights.
All human rights treaties contain provisions of direct relevance to economic, social and
cultural rights. Even the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and othertreaties apparently dealing exclusively with civil and political rights, in recognizing therights to life, equal protection of the law and freedom of association, indirectly recog-nize components of economic, social and cultural rights. Courts in many jurisdictionshave acknowledged this.
13For example, many courts have held that the right to life
must include other rights that are essential to a basic quality of life, such as educationand health care. The continued categorization of rights into these two traditional groupsis becoming increasingly meaningless and irrelevant, the product of a flawed approach to understanding and interpreting human rights law and human rights viola-tions. Many human rights are essentially permeable. Civil and political rights and eco-nomic, social and cultural rights should be merged, not divorced.
14In this way, 
all human rights standards can be used to bolster economic, social and cultural 
rights claims.
This unified approach to human rights encompasses the principles of equality and non-
discrimination, which form the basis of human rights law. These principles include equaltreatment, equal protection of the law, equal opportunity and substantive equality.Although generally associated with civil and political rights, these principles applyequally to economic, social and cultural rights. Their significance will continue to ex-pand, particularly as forms of substantive equality gain greater recognition and asequality rights are recognized as entailing positive obligations to act, and not merely ob-ligations of governmental restraint.
15
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) remains the
foundational treaty on economic, social and cultural rights. It recognizes the rights to:
■Self-determination (art. 1);
■Equality for men and women (art. 3);
■Work and favourable conditions of work (arts. 6 and 7);
■Form and join trade unions (art. 8);
■Social security (art. 9);
■Protection of the family, mothers and children (art. 10);
■An adequate standard of living, including adequate food, clothing and housing (art. 11);
■The highest attainable level of health and health care (art. 12);
■Education (art. 13);
■Free and compulsory primary education (art. 14);
■Take part in cultural life; benefit from scientific progress: and benefit from the protection of scientific, literary or artistic production of which one is the author(art. 15).
16
As of April 2004, 149 States had become parties to the Covenant and so had voluntar-ily undertaken to implement and give effect to the norms and provisions it establishes.Another six States had signed but not yet ratified the Covenant, indicating their accept-ance of the rights it recognizes, but not yet their acceptance of obligations in relationto them. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights monitors States’ com-pliance with their obligations under the Covenant. It has issued numerous concludingobservations on the periodic reports submitted by States on their implementation of theCovenant. It has also adopted a series of general comments on the interpretation andapplication of various provisions of the Covenant.
515See, for instance, Schacter v. Canada (1990), Federal Court of Appeal of Canada, 2 F.C. 129 (Ct. App.).
See also Paul Hunt, Reclaiming Social Rights: International and Comparative Perspectives (Aldershot,
Dartmouth Publishing Company, 1996), pp. 95-106.
16In addition to the rights contained in the Covenant, national human rights institutions will also need to beaware of international legal rules relating to derogations, restrictions and limitations which Governmentsmay attempt to invoke, and should have well-prepared strategies for confronting any spurious attemptsby States to use these principles as a justification for abrogating obligations to promote the enjoyment ofthese rights. National human rights institutions should ensure that any derogations, restrictions orlimitations sought by States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rightsunder articles 4 and 5 satisfy the following criteria: they are in conformity with law; they are necessary ina democratic society; they are carried out to protect the rights of others; the measures are proportionateto the objectives sought; the measures proposed are the least intrusive and restrictive option; there is noarbitrary discrimination against any individual or group; and the measures are both reasonable andjustifiable.
In 1993, the World Conference on Human Rights recommended the elaboration and
adoption of an optional protocol to the Covenant that would grant individuals andgroups the right to submit communications (complaints) concerning non-compliancewith the Covenant. At its fifteenth session, in Geneva in 1996, the Committee con-cluded its consideration of a draft protocol
17and submitted it to the Commission on
Human Rights at its fifty-third session, in Geneva in 1997. The proposed optional pro-tocol has yet to be adopted by the relevant United Nations organs. 
General comments

Nations human rights treaty bodies are to be found in United Nations document HRI/GEN/1/Rev. 6.
719Under the Social Charter, for instance, a methodology labelled a "decency threshold" has been developed
and applied. In determining compliance by States parties with the right established under article 4.1 of theCharter ("the right of workers to a remuneration such as will give them and their families a decentstandard of living"), the European Committee of Social Rights, while recognizing the diversity of social andeconomic conditions in States parties, has determined that any wage which is less than 68 per cent of theaverage national wage, combined with compensatory measures, would fail to attain the "decencythreshold" and would not fulfil the norms of the Charter. This measurement of compliance demonstratesclearly that justiciable precision can be generated by adjudicating bodies from relatively imprecise normsand that violations can be derived, even if based on what may be perceived as relatively vague provisions.ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS STANDARDS
2. The main human rights bodies
Many international and regional human rights bodies focus on economic, social and
cultural rights. They provide insight into the nature and content of economic, socialand cultural rights, and have developed substantial bodies of jurisprudence on theserights. The most significant of the institutions dealing with economic, social andcultural rights are:
■The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitorsimplementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights; 
■The European Committee of Social Rights, which monitors implementation of theEuropean Social Charter
19and examines complaints under a collective complaints
procedure;
■The European Court of Human Rights, which monitors the European Conventionon Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;
■The (United Nations) Commission on Human Rights and its Sub-Commission onthe Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, and the special rapporteursappointed by them to study various issues concerning economic, social andcultural rights.
Other sources of guidance on State obligations relating to economic, social
and cultural rights
Several other authoritative statements provide further guidance on the nature and sub-
stance of State obligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights.
In 1986, a group of distinguished international experts in international law, meeting 
at the University of Limburg at Maastricht, the Netherlands, developed a set of princi-ples on obligations in relation to economic, social and cultural rights, the Limburg
Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Socialand Cultural Rights . These principles set out views on the interpretation of key provi-
sions of the Covenant. They provide a comprehensive framework for understanding thelegal nature of the norms found in the Covenant and are widely used as a means of in-terpreting those norms. They preceded General Comment No. 3 of 1990 of theCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the nature of States parties’ ob-ligations under the Covenant and were very influential when the Committee came toprepare that general comment. The Limburg Principles also deal with reporting byStates on their compliance with the Covenant. The Limburg Principles are included inthe annex to this handbook.
In 1992, Danilo Türk, Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (now the Sub-Commission on thePromotion and Protection of Human Rights) on the realization of economic, social andcultural rights, developed some basic postulates to guide any approach to economic,social and cultural rights. His postulates relate mainly to the nature of State obligationswith respect to these rights.
In 1997, the Limburg Principles were supplemented by guidelines prepared at another
meeting of international law experts, at Maastricht. The Maastricht Guidelines on
Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights discuss the significance of economic,
social and cultural rights, violations of these rights through acts of commission andomission, responsibility for violations and the entitlement of victims to effective reme-dies. The Maastricht Guidelines are also included in the annex to this handbook.
8ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS STANDARDS
3. Basic postulates proposed by Danilo Türk20
a) All States possess varying degrees of legal obligations to fulfil economic, social
and cultural rights. These obligations have local, national, regional andinternational dimensions.
b) Economic, social and cultural rights are interdependent with, and are as legal in
nature as, civil and political rights. They are non-temporal in nature; theirapplication and relevance should be consistent and sustainable, notwithstandingthe frequent ebb and flow of both the internal and external economicenvironment. Constant attention must be paid to utilizing “all availableresources” towards the fulfilment of these human rights.
c) While specific State obligations may differ, all human rights must be applied on a
basis of equality of access and opportunity, in fact and in law, for all persons. Duepriority must be placed on those who are most vulnerable and disadvantaged andconsequently least able to achieve these rights for themselves.
d) States with specific legal obligations to fulfil economic, social and cultural rights
are obliged, regardless of their level of economic development, to ensure respectfor minimum subsistence rights for all.
e) Legal obligations towards the realization of economic, social and cultural rights
are multidimensional. At the macro-level they affect: (i) national and localgovernments and agencies, as well as third parties capable of breaching thesenorms; (ii) the international community of States; and (iii) intergovernmentalorganizations and agencies.
f) Stemming from point (e), all actors with either implicit or explicit mandates vis-à-
vis the realization of economic, social and cultural rights should recognize thedirect applicability of their work to the issue of economic, social and culturalrights, as well as ensuring that the policies, projects, perspectives andprogrammes pursued by them do not harm the prospects of these rights beingrealized nor the capability of a State to fulfil its own legal responsibilities.
g) Human rights do not exist in a vacuum. The fulfilment of all rights, including
those of a socio-economic nature, is contingent upon a wide variety of economic,social, political, historical, philosophical and legal choices and forces. Each ofthem, in addition to others, will play a role in the realization of these rights. Noneshould be over-emphasized and none should be forgotten.
h) The increasing integration and internationalization of the global economy, as
well as of political and social structures and processes, increase the importanceof international cooperation and responsibility.

B. S TATE OBLIGATIONS
Article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights outlines
the basic obligations of States parties in relation to each of the rights found in theCovenant.
21National human rights institutions will need to become familiar with the
terms of article 2, how these terms have been interpreted and how this article can beused to strengthen the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights at the domes-tic level.
Article 2 provides
1. Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individu-
ally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economicand technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achiev-ing progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the presentCovenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of leg-islative measures.
2. The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to guarantee that the
rights enunciated in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimi-nation of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or otheropinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
3. Developing countries, with due regard to human rights and their national
economy, may determine to what extent they would guarantee the economicrights recognized in the present Covenant to non-nationals.
Several key principles of article 2, as well as the general obligations created by the recog-
nition of economic, social and cultural rights, require further elaboration. These are:
■“undertakes to take steps ... by all appropriate means, including particularly theadoption of legislative measures”;
■“with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights”
■“to the maximum of its available resources”;
■“without discrimination”;
■“through international assistance and cooperation”;
■The obligation to respect;
■The obligation to protect;
■The obligation to fulfil.
“undertakes to take steps ... by all appropriate means,
including particularly the adoption of legislative measures”
Article 2.1 requires States parties to begin immediately to take measures towards the
full enjoyment of all the rights in the Covenant by everyone. In many cases, the adop-tion of legislation will be indispensable if economic, social and cultural rights are to beenforceable. But laws alone are not a sufficient response to the Covenant obligations.Administrative, judicial, policy, economic, social and educational measures and all othernecessary steps will be required of Governments to ensure these rights to all. As impor-tant as it is, the law alone is rarely enough to ensure the widespread enjoyment of eco-nomic, social and cultural rights.
921One of the more influential works towards defining State obligations is Philip Alston and Gerard Quinn,
"The nature and scope of States Parties' obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Socialand Cultural Rights", in Human Rights Quarterly , vol. 9, No. 2 (May, 1987), pp. 156-229.
Under article 2.1 States parties may be obliged to undertake legislative action in some
instances, particularly when existing laws are clearly incompatible with the obligationsassumed under the Covenant. This would be the case, for instance, when a law ispatently discriminatory or has the express effect of preventing the enjoyment of any ofthe rights contained in the Covenant, or when legislation allows the violation of rights,especially in terms of the negative duties of States. For example, laws allowingGovernments to remove people violently from their homes, or their eviction withoutdue process of law, would require amendment so that domestic legislation conformswith the Covenant. According to the Limburg Principles, this means:
17. At the national level States Parties shall use all appropriate means, including
legislative, administrative, judicial, economic, social and educational meas-ures, consistent with the nature of the rights in order to fulfil their obligationsunder the Covenant.
18. Legislative measures alone are not sufficient to fulfil the obligations of the
Covenant. It should be noted, however, that article 2 (1) would often requirelegislative action to be taken in cases where existing legislation is in violationof the obligations assumed under the Covenant.
19. States Parties shall provide for effective remedies including, where appropri-
ate, judicial remedies.
20. The appropriateness of the means to be applied in a particular State shall be
determined by that State Party, and shall be subject to review by the UnitedNations Economic and Social Council, with the assistance of the Committee[on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]. Such review shall be without prej-udice to the competence of the other organs established pursuant to theCharter of the United Nations.
“with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights”
The progressive realization component of the Covenant is often mistakenly taken to im-
ply that economic, social and cultural rights can be realized only when a countryreaches a certain level of economic development. This is neither the intent nor the le-gal interpretation of this provision. Rather, this duty obliges all States parties, notwith-standing the level of national wealth, to move as quickly as possible towards therealization of economic, social and cultural rights.
22The Covenant requires the effec-
tive and equitable use of resources immediately.
According to General Comment No. 3 of the Committee on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights on the nature of States parties’ obligations (see annex), while the full re-alization of the relevant rights may be achieved progressively, steps towards that goalmust be taken within a reasonably short time after the Covenant’s entry into force fora State party. Therefore, a State’s failure to take steps is a violation of the Covenant. Theobligation to protect economic, social and cultural rights also requires States to developtargeted, legally consistent and sufficiently progressive policies to secure the rights con-tained in the Covenant. The use of indicators as a means of monitoring and evaluatingspecific aspects of economic, social and cultural rights appears to be increasingly ac-cepted as a “step” towards the implementation of the Covenant.
23
1022See General Comment No. 3 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the nature of
States parties' obligations, para. 9.
23See, for instance, preliminary work on the possible use of indicators with respect to these rights in theprogress report prepared by Danilo Türk, Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion andProtection of Human Rights on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights(E/CN.4/Sub.2/1990/19), chapter I, “Social and economic indicators and their role in the realization ofeconomic, social and cultural rights”, paras. 1-105.
The Limburg Principles highlight that:
16. All States Parties have an obligation to begin immediately to take steps to-
wards full realization of the rights contained in the Covenant.
The phrase “to achieve progressively” does not mean or imply that States have the right
to defer indefinitely efforts to ensure the enjoyment of the rights contained in theCovenant. That kind of deferral would be inconsistent with international law.
Although certain rights, by their nature, may be more closely linked to the progressive
implementation rule, many obligations under the Covenant are clearly required to beimplemented immediately. This applies especially to the non-discrimination provisionsand the obligation of States parties to refrain from actively violating economic, socialand cultural rights or from withdrawing legal and other protections relating to theserights.
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has asserted that this obliga-
tion exists independently of an increase in available resources. It recognizes that allavailable resources must be devoted in the most effective way possible towards the re-alization of the rights enshrined in the Covenant. The Limburg Principles address the is-sue of progressivity in the following terms:
21. The obligation “to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights” re-
quires States Parties to move as expeditiously as possible towards the realiza-tion of the rights. Under no circumstances shall this be interpreted asimplying for States the right to defer indefinitely efforts to ensure full realiza-tion. On the contrary all States Parties have the obligation to begin immedi-ately to take steps to fulfil their obligations under the Covenant.
22. Some obligations under the Covenant require immediate implementation in
full by all States Parties, such as the prohibition of discrimination in article 2(2) of the Covenant.
23. The obligation of progressive achievement exists independently of the in-
crease in resources; it requires effective use of resources available.
24. Progressive implementation can be effected not only by increasing resources,
but also by the development of societal resources necessary for the realiza-tion by everyone of the rights recognized in the Covenant.
Acceptance of the progressive realization of rights is not restricted to economic, social
and cultural rights.
24However, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights alone uses the term “progressive” in relation to obligations. This doesnot affect the legal nature of the rights and does not imply that no immediate obliga-tions exist with regard to the Covenant. The obligation requires States to show dis-cernible progress towards the enjoyment by everyone of the rights contained in theCovenant. States cannot use the notion of progress as a pretext for failing to complywith the Covenant, nor can they justify limitations of or derogation from economic, so-cial and cultural rights on that basis. National human rights institutions and others,however, will need to guard against the progressive realization clause being used as anescape hatch by States seeking to avoid their obligations under the Covenant.
1124"The HRC [Human Rights Committee] has interpreted article 6 [of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, the right to life] as encompassing wide-ranging positive obligations, some of which areclearly of a progressive nature. For example, matters such as infant mortality, malnutrition, and publichealth schemes have been raised. This approach was echoed in the collective opinion of the HRC asexpressed in its first General Comment on article 6. Views under the Optional Protocol have also suggestedthat there is a preventative or positive aspect to article 6." (Dominic McGoldrick, The Human Rights
Committee: Its Role in the Development of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Oxford,
Clarendon Press, 1994), p. 346).
New interpretations of the principle of progressive realization may need to be devel-
oped in order to ensure that public officials and courts understand that States mustmove as expeditiously as possible towards the full realization of the rights found in theCovenant. This standard must be viewed, used and acted upon by States in a positiveway to prevent or reverse any regressive policies, laws or practices negatively affectingthe full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. It implies, by necessity, an ob-ligation on States to improve the overall enjoyment of particular rights and presumes aconstantly expanding web of legal protection for all rights holders.
The obligation of progressive realization includes an obligation not to take or permit re-
gressive measures. An economic or social right that cannot be ensured in full must beensured to the maximum extent possible. This partial realization does not violate theCovenant. But regression from a higher level of enjoyment, partial or full, to a lowerlevel of enjoyment may constitute a violation of the Covenant. 
Any deliberately regressive measures, such as rescinding legislation affecting the enjoy-
ment of economic, social and cultural rights, can only be justified by reference to thetotality of the rights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full utiliza-tion of a State’s maximum available resources. Similarly, the Committee on Economic,Social and Cultural Rights has emphasized that “policies and legislation should … notbe designed to benefit already advantaged social groups at the expense of others”.
25
“to the maximum of its available resources”
The term “available resources” includes both domestic resources and any international
economic or technical assistance or cooperation available to a State. The term coversboth public expenditure and all other resources that can be applied towards the full re-alization of economic, social and cultural rights.
26
Like the progressive realization provision, the “available resources” standard is also of-ten used to justify the non-enjoyment or violation of economic, social and culturalrights. However, as recognized in the Limburg Principles, this requirement obliges aState to ensure minimum subsistence rights for everyone, regardless of the level of itseconomic development, and is by no means intended as a method of non-compliancefor poor States.
27
According to the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and CulturalRights, “as established by Limburg Principles 25-28, and confirmed by the developingjurisprudence of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, resourcescarcity does not relieve States of certain minimum obligations in respect of the imple-mentation of economic, social and cultural rights”.

1225General Comment No. 4 on the right to adequate housing, para. 11.
26According to one author, "'resources" can be divided into the following five categories: 1. human
resources; 2. technological resources; 3. information resources; 4. natural resources; and 5. financialresources. Referring to the phrase "maximum of available resources", he asserts: "It is a difficult one—two warring adjectives describing an undefined noun. 'Maximum' stands for idealism; 'available' standsfor reality. 'Maximum' is the sword of human rights rhetoric; 'available' is the wiggle room for the State".(Robert E. Robertson, "Measuring State compliance with the obligation to devote the 'maximum availableresources' to realising economic, social and cultural rights" in Human Rights Quarterly , vol. 16, No. 4
(November, 1994), pp. 693- 694).
27Principles 25 to 28 of the Limburg Principles state: "25. States parties are obligated, regardless of the levelof economic development, to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all; 26. 'Its availableresources' refers to both the resources within a State and those available from the internationalcommunity through international cooperation and assistance; 27. In determining whether adequatemeasures have been taken for the realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant attention shall bepaid to equitable and effective use of and access to the available resources; 28. In the use of the availableresources due priority shall be given to the realization of rights recognized in the Covenant, mindful of theneed to assure to everyone the satisfaction of subsistence requirements as well as the provision of essentialservices."
28Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (guideline 10). 
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No. 4
on the right to adequate housing says:
Measures designed to satisfy a State Party’s obligations in respect of the right to adequate
housing may reflect whatever mix of public and private sector measures is considered appro-priate. While in some States public financing of housing might most usefully be spent on di-rect construction of new housing, in most cases experience has shown the inability ofGovernments to fully satisfy housing deficits with publicly built housing. The promotion byStates parties of “enabling strategies”, combined with a full commitment to obligations con-cerning the right to adequate housing, should thus be encouraged. In essence, the obliga-tion is to demonstrate that, in aggregate, the measures being taken are sufficient to realizethe right for every individual in the shortest possible time in accordance with the maximumof available resources. (para. 14) 
Many of the measures that will be required will involve resource allocations and policy initia-
tives of a general kind. Nevertheless, the role of formal legislative and administrative meas-ures should not be underestimated in this context ... (para. 15)
The requirement to devote the maximum of available resources to the full realization of
economic, social and cultural rights affects government decisions about budgets andexpenditure. In making decisions about the expenditure of public money, States are re-quired to give priority to meeting their treaty obligations before funding discretionaryactivities. Similarly, in making decisions about the level of taxation to impose, Statesmust ensure that they raise sufficient revenue to be able to assure to everyone the sat-isfaction of subsistence requirements and the provision of essential services.
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has implied that where there
is no apparent justification for a reduction in public expenditure on programmes relatedto economic, social and cultural rights the State might be considered to have violatedits obligations under the Covenant. In determining, in the framework of “the maximumof available resources”, whether public expenditure towards securing the norms of theCovenant is sufficient in relation to overall expenditure, the Committee has found it dif-ficult to make unequivocal statements. However, it has implied that, in the absence ofa reasonable justification for a reduction in public expenditure, a State could be con-strued as having violated the Covenant. Additionally, on many occasions it has issueddetailed requests that would require positive State intervention.
29
“without discrimination”
Article 2.2 of the Covenant provides for the realization of economic, social and cultural
rights without discrimination. This article obliges States to desist from discriminatorybehaviour and to alter laws and practices which allow discrimination. States must alsoprohibit private persons and bodies (third parties) from discriminating in any field ofpublic life. States parties should ensure judicial and other recourse procedures wherediscrimination occurs. The article lists many prohibited grounds of discrimination: “race,colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, prop-erty, birth or other status”. This list is not exhaustive. Discrimination on any otherground that impairs the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights must be elim-inated. So discrimination based on age, wealth, income level or sexual orientationwould also be prohibited.
1329In the case of the Dominican Republic, the Committee asserted: "All persons residing in extremely
precarious conditions such as those residing under bridges, on cliff sides, in homes dangerously close torivers, ravine dwellers, residents of Barrancones and Puente Duarte, and the more than 3,000 familiesevicted between 1986-1994 who have yet to receive relocation sites (from Villa Juana, Villa Consuelo, LosFrailes, San Carlos, Guachupita, La Fuente, Zona Colonial, Maquiteria, Cristo Rey, La Cuarenta, Los Ríosand La Zurza), should all be ensured, in a rapid manner, the provision of adequate housing in fullconformity with the provisions of the Covenant". Official Records of the Economic and Social
Council,1995, Supplement No.3 (E/1995/22-E/C.12/1994/20), para. 327.
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discriminationprovide that special measures taken to ensure equal enjoyment of economic, social andcultural rights for those protected by the respective convention are not discriminatory.The Limburg Principles extend that approach to marginalized and disadvantagedgroups and individuals generally.
30Special measures must not lead to the maintenance
of separate rights for different groups and must be discontinued after their intendedobjectives have been achieved. This principle applies to affirmative action programmes,for example. 
“through international assistance and cooperation”
State obligations under article 2 are to be performed “individually and through inter-
national assistance and cooperation”. The Covenant recognizes that many States willbe unable to meet their obligations acting alone and that they will require internationalsupport. This provision has two dimensions: an obligation to receive and an obligationto provide.
Often States which are in the course of development or transition do not have the re-
sources to ensure the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights for all theircitizens immediately or within a short period. For that reason, the Covenant requiresnot immediate implementation in full, but progressive realization to the maximum ofavailable resources. But the Covenant also requires that, where necessary, States shouldaccept external assistance for their programme of progressive realization. External as-sistance must be considered part of the available resources. A State cannot adopt anisolationist stance or an ideology of immediate self-sufficiency when it is unable to meetits obligations in relation to economic, social and cultural rights and external assistanceis available.
States which have adequate means to provide support have an obligation to provide it
to States which cannot financially meet their obligations to assure economic, social andcultural rights to all within their jurisdiction. The requirement concerning internationalassistance and cooperation applies both ways. States able to provide assistance shouldbe accountable for their actions and omissions if they do so inadequately or not at all.
1430Principles 35 to 41 of the Limburg Principles provide: "35. Article 2 (2) calls for immediate application and
involves an explicit guarantee on behalf of the States parties. It should, therefore, be made subject tojudicial review and other recourse procedures; 36. The grounds of discrimination mentioned in article 2 (2)are not exhaustive; 37. Upon becoming a party to the Covenant States shall eliminate de jure
discrimination by abolishing without delay any discriminatory laws, regulations and practices (includingacts of omission as well as commission) affecting the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights;38. De facto discrimination occurring as a result of the unequal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural
rights, on account of a lack of resources or otherwise, should be brought to an end as speedily as possible;39. Special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain groups orindividuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure to such groups or individualsequal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights shall not be deemed discrimination, provided,however, that such measures do not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate rights fordifferent groups and that such measures shall not be continued after their intended objectives have beenachieved; 40. Article 2 (2) demands from States parties that they prohibit private persons and bodies frompractising discrimination in any field of public life; 41. "In the application of article 2 (2) due regard shouldbe paid to all relevant international instruments, including the Declaration and the InternationalConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, as well as to the activities of thesupervisory committee (CERD) under the said Convention."
The obligation to respect
In addition to the various specific obligations under article 2.1 of the Covenant, there
are three general obligations within the legal framework of economic, social and cul-tural rights: the obligations to respect, to protect and to fulfil these rights.
31
The obligation to respect economic, social and cultural rights requires States to abstainfrom performing, sponsoring or tolerating any practice, policy or legal measure violat-ing the integrity of individuals or infringing upon their freedom to use those material orother resources available to them in ways they find most appropriate to satisfy eco-nomic, social and cultural rights.
32This obligation protects citizens from arbitrary inter-
ference with the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. For instance, thearbitrary forced eviction of members of a community from their homes would violatethis obligation (see box, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Standards: 4. GeneralComments and forced evictions). The obligation to respect relates to:
■The right to be free from all forms of discrimination;
■The right of participation, including the right of citizens to seek to influence relevantlaws or policies;
■The rights of organization, assembly and association, particularly in community-based and non-governmental organizations;
■The right to equality of treatment, particularly in the allocation of resources andaccess to credit;
■The right to be free to enjoy rights already attained, without arbitrary interferenceby the State;
■The right not to be arbitrarily excluded from access to a school or hospital or otherservice related to economic, social and cultural rights.
1531 According to guideline 6 of the Maastricht Guidelines, "Like civil and political rights, economic, social and
cultural rights impose three different types of obligations on States: the obligations to respect, protect andfulfil. Failure to perform any one of these three obligations constitutes a violation of such rights. Theobligation to respect requires States to refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of economic, social
and cultural rights. Thus, the right to housing is violated if the State engages in arbitrary forced evictions.The obligation to protect requires States to prevent violations of such rights by third parties. Thus, the
failure to ensure that private employers comply with basic labour standards may amount to a violation ofthe right to work or the right to just and favourable conditions of work. The obligation to fulfil requires
States to take appropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial and other measures towards thefull realization of such rights. Thus, the failure of States to provide essential primary health care to thosein need may amount to a violation."
32 In this context, Governments should desist from restricting the right to popular participation and must
accept the corresponding commitment to facilitate and create economic, social and political conditionsconducive to self-help initiatives by the beneficiaries of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as torespect the rights to organize and assemble freely, which are essential for the assertion of demands bythose entitled to economic, social and cultural rights.
16ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS STANDARDS
4. General comments and forced evictions
Of the acts of commission and omission considered by the Committee on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights as constituting violations of the International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, none has received more prominence than thepractice of forced eviction. The Committee’s General Comment No. 4 on the rightto adequate housing (1991) stipulates that “instances of forced evictions are prima
facie incompatible with the requirements of the Covenant and can only be justified
in the most exceptional circumstances, and in accordance with the relevantprinciples of international law”.

In May 1997, the Committee adopted General Comment No. 7, on forced evictions,which significantly expands the protection afforded against eviction. It goesconsiderably further than most previous pronouncements in detailing whatGovernments, landlords and institutions such as the World Bank must do topreclude forced evictions and, by inference, to prevent violations of human rights.This is the first general comment issued by the Committee to address a specificviolation of the Covenant.
General Comment No. 7 deals with the obligation to respect. It asserts that “the
State itself must refrain from forced evictions and ensure that the law is enforcedagainst its agents or third parties who carry out forced evictions”.
The general comment also deals with the obligation to protect. It urges States to
“ensure that legislative and other measures are adequate to prevent and, ifappropriate, punish forced evictions carried out, without appropriate safeguards, byprivate persons or bodies”. Therefore, private landlords, developers andinternational institutions such as the World Bank and any other third parties or non-State actors are subject to the relevant legal obligations and can anticipate theenforcement of the law against them if they carry out forced evictions. Governmentsare required to implement protective domestic laws to punish persons responsiblefor forced evictions carried out without proper safeguards. 
Lastly, General Comment No. 7 provides for the obligation to fulfil. It breaks new
ground by declaring that “evictions should not result in rendering individualshomeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human rights”. As a result,Governments must guarantee that people who are evicted—whether illegally or inaccordance with the law—have alternative housing.
34
According to the former Special Rapporteur on the realization of economic, social andcultural rights, all actors with either implicit or explicit mandates vis-à-vis the realizationof economic, social and cultural rights should recognize the direct applicability of theirwork to the issue of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as ensuring that thepolicies, projects, perspectives and programmes pursued by them do not harm the prospects of these rights being realized nor the capacity of the State to fulfil its ownlegal duties (see box, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Standards: 3. Some basicpostulates proposed by Danilo Türk).
33Paragraph 18 of General Comment No. 4 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on
the right to adequate housing. Similar sentiments can be found in paragraph 6 of the Committee'sGeneral Comment No. 2 on international technical assistance measures, in which the internationalagencies are urged to scrupulously avoid involvement in projects which involve large-scale evictions.
34Scott Leckie, "New United Nations regulations on forced evictions: General Comment No. 7 strengthensright not to be evicted", in Third World Planning Review , vol. 21, No. 1 (February, 1999), pp. 41-61.
Therefore, there is a role not only for States vis-à-vis the realization of economic, social
and cultural rights but also for non-State actors such as international financial institu-tions and transnational corporations, which have a great impact on the enjoyment ofthese rights. The policies of transnational corporations and international financial insti-tutions may lead to violations of economic, social and cultural rights in developingcountries, particularly the poorest countries with the least economic or political lever-age.
35Indirect violations of civil and political rights also may occur in the context of
structural adjustment programmes or large-scale project financing, and transnationalcorporations may encourage certain employment environments which run counter tothe enjoyment of economic, social cultural rights.
36
While international financial institutions and transnational corporations share the obli-gation to respect economic, social and cultural rights, there is no international mecha-nism to hold them specifically accountable for their actions and omissions. UnlikeStates, they do not submit periodic reports to the Committee on Economic, Social andCultural Rights and they are not required to attend meetings of the Committee to re-spond to questions from Committee members. However, States that are members ofinternational financial institutions submit periodic reports to, and appear before, theCommittee. Their activities as members of the international financial institutions cantherefore be monitored to ensure that they are consistent with the States’ obligationsunder the Covenant.
37Vigilance by national human rights institutions in this process is
also important. 
The obligation to protect
The obligation to protect economic, social and cultural rights requires the State and its
agents to prevent the violation of any individual’s rights by any other individual or non-State actor. Where a third party infringes economic, social and cultural rights, the pub-lic authorities should act to preclude further violations and to guarantee access to legalremedies for any victims of the infringement. The State must also establish effectivemeasures to protect persons from racial or other forms of discrimination, harassment,withdrawal of services, or other threats. 
The obligation to protect entails:
■Immediate steps to ensure that violations of economic, social and cultural rights by
the State and its agents are prevented;
■Immediate steps to ensure that violations of economic, social and cultural rights bythird parties are prevented;
■Ensuring access to impartial legal remedies in cases of alleged violation ofeconomic, social and cultural rights by State or non-State actors;
1735Hence the reference in General Comment No. 2 on international technical assistance measures to the
effect that the international agencies should "scrupulously avoid involvement in projects which...involvelarge-scale evictions or displacement of persons without the provision of all appropriate protection andcompensation" (para. 6). See also Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) andINHURED International, Justice Denied: Human Rights and the International Financial Institutions
(Kathmandu, 1994).
36Sigrun Skogly, "Structural adjustment and development: human rights—an agenda for change" in Human
Rights Quarterly , vol. 15, No. 4, 1993, p. 751.
37The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights already regularly raises this issue under article 2.1
of the Covenant.
■Active measures to protect all persons from racial or other forms of discrimination,
harassment and the withdrawal of services.38
Private actors can also violate economic, social and cultural rights and be held liable fortheir violations.
39Human rights law is no longer merely a public law matter but includes
the private domain as well.40Private actors have duties to observe human rights and
the State has correlative duties to ensure the protection of individuals’ rights from vio-lation by third parties not generally linked to the State.
41
Similarly, employers, corporations, landlords, teachers, doctors and any other citizen ca-pable of violating an individual’s rights as a consequence of encouragement to do so orneglect by the State are increasingly being held accountable as notions of State respon-sibility expand beyond traditional confines.
42For example, in its General Comment
No.12 on the right to adequate food, the Committee on Economic, Social and CulturalRights stated: “the obligation to protect requires measures by the State to ensure thatenterprises or individuals do not deprive individuals of their access to adequate food”. 
The obligation to fulfil
The obligation to fulfil economic, social and cultural rights requires positive measures
by the State when other measures have not succeeded in ensuring the full realizationof these rights. This obligation can entail issues such as public expenditure, governmen-tal regulation of the economy, the provision of basic public services and infrastructure,taxation and other redistributive economic measures. 
1838The Maastricht Guidelines add the following perspectives: State responsibility 16. The violations referred
to in section II are in principle imputable to the State within whose jurisdiction they occur. As aconsequence, the State responsible must establish mechanisms to correct such violations, includingmonitoring, investigation, prosecution, and remedies for victims. Acts by non-State entities 18. The
obligation to protect includes the State's responsibility to ensure that private entities or individuals,including transnational corporations over which they exercise jurisdiction, do not deprive individuals oftheir economic, social and cultural rights. States are responsible for violations of economic, social andcultural rights that result from their failure to exercise due diligence in controlling the behaviour of suchnon-State actors. Acts by international organizations 19. The obligations of States to protect economic,
social and cultural rights extend also to their participation in international organizations, where they actcollectively. It is particularly important for States to use their influence to ensure that violations do notresult from the programmes and policies of the organizations of which they are members. It is crucial forthe elimination of violations of economic, social and cultural rights for international organizations,including international financial institutions, to correct their policies and practices so that they do not resultin deprivation of economic, social and cultural rights. Member States of such organizations, individually orthrough the governing bodies, as well as the secretariat and non-governmental organizations shouldencourage and generalize the trend of several such organizations to revise their policies and programmesto take into account issues of economic, social and cultural rights, especially when these policies andprogrammes are implemented in countries that lack the resources to resist the pressure brought byinternational institutions on their decision-making affecting economic, social and cultural rights.

40The Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on the question of the impunity of perpetrators of human
rights violations stressed in 1996: "Violations of economic, social and cultural rights can also beperpetuated by private individuals. In the vast majority of States, such violations are punishable offencesor are, at any rate, subject to a procedure of civil compensation. It is for the State to devise an adequatelegal framework." (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/15, para. 135).

Human Rights", in Protecting Human Rights: The European Dimension (Studies in honour of Gerard J.
Wiarda) , F. Matscher and H. Petzold, eds., (Koln, Carl HeymansVerlag, 1988). The Limburg Principles
provide support by suggesting that States parties must prohibit private persons and bodies from practisingdiscrimination in any field of public life (principle 40).
42For instance, in General Comment No. 5 on persons with disabilities, the Committee on Economic, Socialand Cultural Rights appeals to States parties to "ensure that not only the public sphere but also the privatesphere are, within appropriate limits, subject to regulation to ensure the equitable treatment of personswith disabilities ... it is essential that private employers, private suppliers of goods and services and othernon-public entities should be subject to both non-discrimination and equality norms in relation to personswith disabilities". (para. 11).
In General Comment No.12 on the right to adequate food and General Comment
No.13 on the right to education, the Committee declares that the “obligation to fulfil
incorporates both an obligation to facilitate and an obligation to provide ”. Facilitating
involves positive initiatives to enable the full enjoyment of economic, social and culturalrights. Providing involves direct or indirect State services when individuals or groups areunable, for reasons beyond their control, to realize the right themselves by the meansat their disposal. In General Comment No.14 on the right to the highest attainable stan-dard of health, the Committee states that the obligation to fulfil includes the obligationto promote , in recognition of the critical importance of health promotion in the work
of the World Health Organization and other organizations.
The Committee has also given examples of the content of the obligation to fulfil in rela-
tion to specific economic, social and cultural rights. In General Comment No.12, it states:“The obligation to fulfil (facilitate ) means the State must proactively engage in activities
intended to strengthen people’s access to and utilization of resources and means to en-sure their livelihood, including food security.” In General Comment No.13, theCommittee states: “The obligation to fulfil (facilitate) requires States to take positivemeasures that enable and assist individuals and communities to enjoy the right to edu-cation” while also abiding by their “obligation to fulfil (provide) the right to education”.
Ultimately, the obligation to fulfil comprises those active measures by a Government
necessary to guarantee each person within its jurisdiction opportunities to have full ac-cess to all entitlements to economic, social and cultural rights that cannot be securedthrough exclusively personal efforts.
Examples of the obligation to fulfil include:
■Allocating an adequate proportion of public expenditure to the progressive
realization of economic, social and cultural rights;
■State provision of public services, including infrastructure, water, electricity,sanitation, heating, sewerage, drainage, roads, health care facilities and emergencyservices;
■Developing targeted plans of action and strategies on economic, social and culturalrights, with specific time frames and financial requirements, with a view to the fullrealization of these rights;
■Establishing benchmarks for monitoring economic, social and cultural rights,including the use of appropriate indicators to this end;
■Undertaking without delay comprehensive legislative and policy review of all laws,regulations or other directives having any negative bearing on the fulfilment ofeconomic, social and cultural rights; 
■Establishing both legislative and policy recognition of economic, social and culturalrights;
■Giving priority attention to and targeting strategies towards satisfying theeconomic, social and cultural rights of disadvantaged groups, including the elderly,children, the physically disabled, the terminally ill, HIV-positive individuals, personswith persistent medical problems, the mentally ill, victims of natural disasters andpeople living in disaster prone areas;
■While these are State obligations, they can be monitored and encouraged bynational human rights institutions in the domestic context and in some instancesthe national institutions can facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations. Forreasons of both relevance and effectiveness, as well as in order to ensure respect forother human rights, such strategies should reflect extensive genuine consultationwith, and participation by, all those affected – including national human rights
19
institutions. Subsequent steps must be taken by Governments to ensure
coordination between ministries and regional and local authorities in order toreconcile related policies with the obligations arising from the Covenant, includingassessing the degree to which economic, social and cultural rights remainunfulfilled. In this regard, appropriate consultation with national human rightsinstitutions may be sought, given many of their mandates in relation to international human rights instruments as provided for in the Paris Principles (see annex).

handbook the two obligations are seen as one: the obligation to fulfil.ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS STANDARDS
5. Disaggregating State obligations—housing rights
The right to adequate housing is one of the more developed economic, social and
cultural rights. The United Nations Housing Rights Programme (UNHRP), a jointinitiative of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) andthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, is the mostimportant international activity concerning housing rights. In this context, UN-HABITAT developed the following matrix of responsibilities of States for the full andprogressive realization of the right to adequate housing and possible actions at thenational and local levels (HS/C/17/INF.6, table 2). Similar exercises could beundertaken by national human rights institutions in relation to other economic,social and cultural rights.

C. S OME CENTRAL CONCEPTS
In this section of the handbook, three core concepts in regard to economic, social and
cultural rights are discussed:
■Minimum core obligations;
■Justiciability and the domestic application of economic, social and cultural rights;
■Avoiding regressive measures.
Minimum core obligations
In its General Comment No. 3, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
argues that States have “minimum core obligations” under the Covenant to ensure abasic level of enjoyment of each economic, social and cultural right.
… the Committee is of the view that a minimum core obligation to ensure the satisfaction
of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights is incumbent upon everyState party. Thus, for example, a State party in which any significant number of individualsis deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health care, of basic shelter and hous-ing, or of the most basic forms of education is, prima facie , failing to discharge its obliga-
tions under the Covenant. If the Covenant were to be read in such a way as not to establishsuch a minimum core obligation, it would be largely deprived of its raison d’être .
44
There is widespread support for this principle.45According to the former Special
Rapporteur on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, Danilo Türk,“States are obliged, regardless of the level of economic development, to ensure respectfor minimum subsistence rights for all”.
46The Commission on Human Rights has urged
States to “consider identifying specific national benchmarks designed to give effect tothe minimum core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of minimum essential levels ofeach of the [economic, social and cultural] rights”.
47The Inter-American Commission
on Human Rights has declared that “the obligation of member States to observe anddefend the human rights of individuals within their jurisdictions, as set forth in both theAmerican Declaration and the American Convention, obligates them, regardless of thelevel of economic development, to guarantee a minimum threshold of these rights”.
48
The Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural rights alsoreaffirm this principle.
49
Do these minimum core obligations apply primarily to the individual enjoyment of aright or to society-wide levels of enjoyment? Proponents of a “minimal threshold ap-proach” have favoured the latter position, asserting “the scope of violation of socio-economic rights would then refer to the percentage of the population not assured of
2244General Comment No. 3, para. 10. This general comment also requires States to move "as expeditiously
and effectively as possible" towards the full realization of the rights in the Covenant (para. 9).
45One of the first articulations of this principle was: "Each right must therefore give rise to an absoluteminimum entitlement in the absence of which a State Party is to be considered to be in violation of itsobligations." (Philip Alston, "Out of the abyss: the challenges confronting the new U.N. Committee onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights" in Human Rights Quarterly , vol. 9, No. 3 (August, 1987), p. 353)

States, Washington D.C.).
49"Every state that has accepted legal obligations …agrees that under all circumstances, including periodscharacterized by resource scarcity, basic minimum obligations and corresponding essential rights remainin place" (Victor Dankwa, Cees Flinterman and Scott Leckie, "Commentary to the Maastricht Guidelineson Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights" (guidelines 9 and 10: minimum core obligationsand availability of resources) in Human Rights Quarterly , vol. 20, No. 3 (August, 1998), p. 717.
this minimal threshold”.50Others, however, have sought to address the question from
the perspective of the people possessing the rights, rather than from that of the Stateobliged to ensure them. One author asserts, “each right must therefore give rise to anabsolute minimum entitlement, in the absence of which a State Party is to be in viola-tion of its obligations”.
51
Minimum core obligations must be seen as a first step, not the conclusion of a processof realizing economic, social and cultural rights. The principle must not be seen as in-volving a minimalist approach. In particular, it should not be used to imply that only theminimum core of an economic, social or cultural right is justiciable. Definitions of thecontent of civil and political rights are being expanded continually; the search for simi-lar clarity with respect to economic, social and cultural rights will continue and shouldnot be viewed as an obstacle to addressing violations of these rights. Already, muchwork has been done to identify the basic components of each economic, social and cul-tural right in terms of both obligation and entitlement.

case for a minimal threshold approach to the economic and social rights" in Yearbook of Human Rights
in Developing Countries 1987/1988 (Copenhagen), p. 341. See also Asbjorn Eide, "Realization of social
and economic rights and the minimum threshold approach", in Human Rights Law Journal , vol. 10, Nos.
1-2 (1989), pp. 35-51.
51"There would be no justification for elevating a 'claim' to the status of a right (with all the connotationsthat concept is generally assumed to have) if its normative content could be so indeterminate as to allowfor the possibility that the right holders possess no particular entitlement to anything." (Philip Alston, "Outof the abyss: the challenges confronting the new U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and CulturalRights" in Human Rights Quarterly , vol. 9, No. 3 (August, 1987), pp. 352-353).
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
1. Affordable measures to promote and protect economic, social and
cultural rights
One argument against economic, social and cultural rights is that fiscal
considerations will always prevent their enjoyment from becoming a reality for allpersons entitled to them. However, many of the obligations associated witheconomic, social and cultural rights do not require regular, large budgetaryexpenditure. 
State duties to ensure the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights and
of all other human rights cover the full spectrum of obligations—from measuresthat are essentially cost-free to those clearly requiring significant public expenditure.Securing economic, social and cultural rights (and civil and political rights) for themost disadvantaged sectors of society will cost the State money. However, not allelements of economic, social and cultural rights necessarily require substantialfinancial allocations. Where funding is required, targeting public funds wisely andefficiently to areas of most need can achieve a great deal. This spending need notbankrupt delicate economies. International law does not indicate that a particularsum or portion of public spending should be devoted to economic, social andcultural rights, but it does oblige Governments to devote the “maximum ofavailable resources” to securing them. 
In relation to the right to housing, for example, many of the core components of
the right are effectively cost-free to the State and require few positive interventionsother than a commitment to implementing human rights and the necessary politicalwill. Such measures as providing security of tenure and land title, measures of landreform, revising national legislation, instituting systems of tax credits, enforcingnon-discrimination provisions, supporting appropriate incentives to the privatesector and allowing community-based and non-governmental organizations tooperate and organize freely may involve a reallocation of resources, but at a levelthat would not stifle economic progress. 
Above all, effective structures must be established to ensure that funds are allocated
consistent with need. This will require positive State involvement to develop policy,legislation and programmes fully consistent with economic, social and culturalrights. Even when a State’s “available resources” are verifiably inadequate,international law requires the Government to ensure the widest possible enjoymentof the relevant rights under the prevailing circumstances and to demonstrate thatevery effort has been made to use all resources that are at its disposal in an effortto satisfy, as a matter of priority, these minimum responsibilities.

2452General Comment No. 3 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the nature of
States parties' obligations (art. 2, para. 1 of the Covenant).
Justiciability and the domestic application of economic, social and cultural rights
Domestic justiciability and the domestic application of the Covenant and other interna-
tional standards that recognize economic, social and cultural rights remain two signifi-cant issues in debates about the core concepts of these rights.
53They relate closely to
the right to effective remedies for persons alleging violations of economic, social andcultural rights.
54
Remedies may be either legal or administrative; in many instances administrative reme-dies may suffice. However, as the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rightsnotes in paragraph 9 of General Comment No. 9 on the domestic application of theCovenant, where a Covenant right cannot be made fully effective without some rolefor the judiciary, judicial remedies are necessary. 
The justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights has long been subject to argu-
ment. In many respects, this has kept these rights from attaining their true legal stature.Some of the legal issues surrounding justiciability are complex, but international accept-ance of the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights is increasing greatly andrapidly, based particularly on the frequent consideration of matters affecting economic,social and cultural rights by domestic courts in many States. In General Comment No.3, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights asserts that “among themeasures which might be considered appropriate, in addition to legislation, is the pro-vision of judicial remedies with respect to the rights which may, in accordance with thenational legal system, be justiciable”. 
The Committee has indicated that a number of articles of the Covenant are capable of
immediate judicial protection and enforcement, including those on non-discrimination(art. 2.2), equal rights of men and women (art. 3), pay equity (art. 7 (a) (i)), trade unions(art. 8), economic and social exploitation of children and young people (art. 10.3), freeand compulsory primary education (art.13.2 (a)), religious and private schools (art. 13.3and 4), and freedom of scientific research and creative activity (art. 15.3). 
In paragraph 3 of General Comment No. 9, the Committee notes:
Questions relating to the domestic application of the Covenant must be considered in
the light of two principles of international law. The first, as reflected in article 27 of theVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, is that “[A] party may not invoke the provi-sions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty”. In other words,States should modify the domestic legal order as necessary in order to give effect totheir treaty obligations. The second principle is reflected in article 8 of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights, according to which “Everyone has the right to an effec-tive remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamentalrights granted him by the constitution or by law”. 
However, a State’s failure to provide a judicial or other remedy is not evidence of the
non-justiciable nature of a particular norm.55Rather, it indicates at best an incomplete
view of human rights. “Denying an individual or group the ability to make constitu-tional claims against the State with respect to nutrition, housing, health and educationexcludes those interests from a process of reasoned interchange and discussion, and
2553Matthew C.R. Craven, "The domestic application of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights" in Netherlands International Law Review , vol. XL, issue 3 (1993), pp. 367-404.
54The Limburg Principles emphasize that "States parties shall provide for effective remedies including, where
appropriate, judicial remedies" (principle 9). Because there does not yet exist an individual complaintsprocedure under the Covenant, the full implementation of the rights this text contains is all the moredependent upon the provision of appropriate laws and remedies at the national level.
55Michael Addo,"The justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights" in Commonwealth Law Bulletin ,
vol. 14, No. 4 (October, 1988), pp. 1425-1432.
forecloses a useful forum for the recognition and redressing of injustices”.56It is not pri-
marily the nature of economic, social and cultural rights that denies judicial enforce-ment of these rights, but the lack of competence or willingness of the adjudicatingbody to entertain, examine and pronounce on claims affecting these rights.
57For 
example, virtually all central components of the right to adequate housing are fully susceptible to judicial review.
58
Also in paragraph 3 of General Comment No. 9, the Committee notes:
…a State party seeking to justify its failure to provide any domestic legal remedies for
violations of economic, social and cultural rights would need to show either that suchremedies are not “appropriate means” within the terms of article 2, paragraph 1, of theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or that, in view of theother means used, they are unnecessary. It will be difficult to show this and theCommittee considers that, in many cases, the other means used could be rendered in-effective if they are not reinforced or complemented by judicial remedies. 
Both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 8) and the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights (art. 2) recognize that any person whose rights have beenviolated has a right to an effective remedy. The International Covenant on Economic,Social and Cultural Rights does not contain a similar provision and does not at presenthave a complaints procedure. However, the Committee has submitted to theCommission on Human Rights a draft optional protocol to the Covenant that would en-able individuals and groups to submit complaints concerning non-compliance with theCovenant. In addition, an increasing number of States have developed judicial and non-judicial remedies for violations of economic, social and cultural rights. 
Where the norms found in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights are not directly subject to a domestic complaints procedure, the Covenant shouldstill play a significant role in the application and interpretation of domestic law. At aminimum, the domestic courts should consider international human rights law as an aidto the interpretation of domestic law and ensure that domestic law is interpreted andapplied consistently with the human rights treaties to which a State is bound. Whereverpossible, courts should avoid decisions that place their State in the position of violatingthe terms of a treaty it has ratified. Indeed, many national constitutions require legisla-tures not to legislate or accept policies manifestly inconsistent with guarantees of eco-nomic, social and cultural rights.

a new South African Constitution", in University of Pennsylvania Law Review , vol. 141, No. 1 (1992), p
28.
57While with regard to the European Convention on Human Rights, "[t]he crucial test in this respect for theinclusion of a particular right in the Convention system does not lie in the subject-matter of that right, butrather in whether it is capable of protection by the Convention machinery, that is by the system ofadjudication" (F.G. Jacobs, "The extension of the European Convention on Human Rights to includeeconomic, social and cultural rights" in Human Rights Review , vol. III, No. 3 (1978), pp. 168-169). See also,

59Moreover, at present complaints alleging violations of economic, social and cultural rights can besubmitted to and adjudicated under numerous international and regional procedures, including within theInternational Labour Organization and UNESCO, and under the San Salvador Protocol to the AmericanConvention on Human Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the European SocialCharter. Similarly, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe arealso responsible for securing some economic and social rights and have certain remedial mechanisms inplace. Additional petition procedures under the International Convention on the Elimination of RacialDiscrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have been invoked in defenceof economic, social and cultural rights. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discriminationagainst Women has an optional protocol authorizing the Committee on the Elimination of Discriminationagainst Women to receive individual complaints. A draft protocol to the International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights to this effect is under consideration.
27Global norms are important precisely because of the difficulties with regard to the do-
mestic applicability or direct validity of international human rights texts in national le-gal systems. However, violations of economic, social and cultural rights can beeffectively combated only through increased incorporation of international norms innational legal structures and enhanced justiciability and enforcement of economic, so-cial and cultural rights at the local level. Indeed, it would be impossible for every humanrights violation to be adjudicated in an international forum. The primary arena for thejudicial enforcement of human rights remains that of domestic law. International hu-man rights law, therefore, places emphasis on the establishment of domestic enforce-ment mechanisms for the protection of human rights. 
27ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
2. The courts and economic, social and cultural rights in South Africa: the
national human rights institution as a judicial monitor
In its judgement in the case of Government of the Republic of South Africa and
others v Grootboom and others 2000 (11) BCLR 1169 (CC), the Constitutional Court
of South Africa made far-reaching decisions concerning economic, social andcultural rights under the South African Constitution. 
Irene Grootboom and 900 other displaced individuals had been living in intolerable
conditions in an informal squatter settlement called Wallacedene. They decided tomove and put up their shacks and shelters on vacant land they called “New Rust”.The land was privately owned and had been earmarked for low-cost housing. In May1999, the occupants at New Rust were forcibly evicted under a magistrates’ courtorder. Their homes were bulldozed and burnt and their possessions destroyed. Theoccupants sheltered on the Wallacedene sports field under whatever temporarystructures they could put together. They launched an urgent application in the HighCourt, which ordered the State to provide the occupants with shelter. The Statechallenged the order before the Constitutional Court.
The South African Human Rights Commission and the Community Law Centre of
the University of the Western Cape applied to be and were admitted as intervenorsin this case and presented written and oral argument before the Court. TheConstitutional Court expressed its appreciation to the Human Rights Commissionand the Community Law Centre for their detailed, helpful and creative approach tothe difficult and sensitive issues involved in this case.
The Constitutional Court ordered the State to act to meet its constitutional
obligation to devise, fund, implement and supervise measures to provide relief tothose in desperate need.
The Court also commented that the Constitution placed a duty on the South African
Human Rights Commission to “monitor and assess the observance of human rightsin the Republic”. The Court ruled that the Commission should monitor and reporton the State’s compliance with its constitutional obligations in accordance with theCourt’s judgement in this case.
The following principles may be useful to ensure that all beneficiaries of economic, so-
cial and cultural rights have access to effective remedies.60
1. The right to effective remedies must be real, practical and non-illusory.
2. The progressive enhancement of domestic legal protections of economic, social
and cultural rights should be seen as a component of the progressive realizationof these rights.
3. Regressive measures with respect to domestic legal protections are not permit-
ted except under extreme circumstances.
4. The judicial duty to interpret consistently extends to legislative omission and is
not satisfied by a formal reliance on the ambiguity rule.
5. Domestic remedies for violations of certain economic, social and cultural rights
are implicit in domestic protections of civil and political rights.
Avoiding retrogressive measures
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has sought to discourage what
it calls “deliberately retrogressive measures” by States parties to the Covenant. It hassaid that such measures “would need to be justified by reference to the totality of therights provided for in the Covenant and in the context of the full use of the maximumavailable resources”.
61A “retrogressive measure” is one that, directly or indirectly, leads
to backward steps being taken with respect to the rights recognized in the Covenant.A deliberately retrogressive measure would be a new law that makes primary educationvoluntary rather than compulsory, as required by the Covenant, or cuts public expendi-ture on maternal health care, resulting in considerable increases in maternal and childmortality.
The Committee limited its criticism to deliberate measures. This does not restrict the
prohibition to measures intended to reduce the level of enjoyment of economic, socialand cultural rights. Rather, the prohibition applies to any measure taken consciouslythat reduces the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, whether or not theregression was an intended and wanted consequence of the measure.
States are expected to act with care and deliberation in taking action that might violate
human rights, directly or indirectly. The prohibition therefore extends to measures takennegligently that reduce the enjoyment of human rights. 
A measure that unintentionally reduces the enjoyment of human rights may not itself
be a deliberately retrogressive measure. The measure, therefore, would not itself violatethe Covenant. However, when the regression becomes apparent, the State is obliged,under its general obligations under the Covenant, to take immediate steps to correctthe measure. The obligation of progressively realizing economic, social and culturalrights implies that there should be no regression by act or omission to a lower level ofenjoyment of these rights.
2860The Maastricht Guidelines also provide: " Access to remedies 22. Any person or group who is a victim of
a violation of an economic, social or cultural right should have access to effective judicial or otherappropriate remedies at both national and international levels. Adequate reparation 23. All victims of
violations of economic, social and cultural rights are entitled to adequate reparation, which may take theform of restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition. No
official sanctioning of violations 24. National judicial and other organs must ensure that any
pronouncements they may make do not result in the official sanctioning of a violation of an internationalobligation of the State concerned. At a minimum, national judiciaries should consider the relevantprovisions of international and regional human rights law as an interpretive aid in formulating anydecisions relating to violations of economic, social and cultural rights."

standards they elaborate, see United Nations, A Handbook on the Establishment and Strengthening of
National Institutions …A. T HE IMPORTANCE OF A BROAD AND CLEARLY
DEFINED MANDATE BASED ON
INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS
The Paris Principles
A national human rights institution is a “body which is established by a Government
under the constitution, or by law or decree, the functions of which are specifically de-fined in terms of the promotion and protection of human rights”.
62
The Principles relating to the status of national institutions, known as the “ParisPrinciples” (see annex), provide international minimum standards for an effective na-tional human rights institution.
63
These Principles require that national human rights institutions have:
■Independence;
■Competence to promote and protect human rights;
■A broad-based mandate clearly set forth in a constitutional or legislative text;
■Pluralism in membership and staff;
■Members appointed through an official act, for a specific duration established inthe act;
■Sufficient resources to fulfil their mandates and perform their functions;
■Accessibility to victims and potential victims of human rights violators;
■A methodology of cooperation with government, non-governmental and private-sector organizations and individuals, nationally and internationally.
In terms of activities, the Principles call for national institutions:
■To submit reports concerning the promotion and protection of human rights;
■To promote and ensure the harmonization of national legislation, regulation and
practices with international human rights instruments to which a State is a party –and their effective implementation;
■To encourage the ratification of international human rights instruments;
■To contribute to the reports which a State is required to submit to United Nationsbodies and committees, and where necessary express an opinion on the subject,with due respect for the institutions’ independence;
■To cooperate with the United Nations and other organizations in the United Nationssystem, the regional institutions and the national institutions of other countries;
■To assist in the formulation of human rights education programmes and to take partin their execution;
■To publicize human rights. 
32ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
3. Mandate of the Fiji Human Rights Commission
The Fiji Human Rights Commission is a statutory body established to administer the
Human Rights Commission Act 1999. The functions of the Fiji Human RightsCommission are outlined in the country’s Constitution and the Human Rights Act1999 and include:
◆To educate the public about the nature and content of the Bill of Rights, includ-
ing its origins in international conventions and other international instruments,and the responsibilities of the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on theElimination of Racial Discrimination and other organs of the General Assembly ofthe United Nations for promoting respect for human rights
◆To make recommendations to the Government about matters affecting compli-
ance with human rights, including the making of a recommendation that a par-ticular question about the legal effect of a provision of the Bill of Rights bereferred to the Supreme Court for its opinion.
Fiji’s constitutional Bill of Rights contains provisions addressing economic, social and
cultural rights, among them labour rights, the right to be free from discriminationon several enumerated grounds, including economic status, and the right to educa-tion. The Constitution requires Parliament to develop programmes to enable disad-vantaged groups to achieve equality of access to education and training, land andhousing and participation in commerce and the civil service.
Fiji’s Human Rights Act acknowledges the importance of the Commission comply-
ing with the Paris Principles.
In addition, national institutions may be authorized to hear and consider complaints
and petitions concerning individual situations. They may also encourage and facilitatemediation and dispute resolution and determine or recommend appropriate reme-dies.
Beyond these minimum standards, an effective national human rights institution re-
quires a supportive external environment in which to work. There must be politicalwill within the government to see the national human rights institution carry out itsmandate. There must be an effective and independent judiciary and other democraticinstitutions, an engaged civil society and a sensitized bureaucracy and military andpolice forces. Equally importantly, the national institution must have determined andcapable personnel. The members of the institution and its staff must be committedto human rights values and experienced in working for human rights. They must becredible human rights advocates in the eyes of civil society, particularly human rightsnon-governmental organizations. They must be well qualified and appropriatelyskilled for the work they are to do. Strong leadership and good management of theinstitution are critical. 
Lastly, an effective national human rights institution requires general understanding
and acceptance of its unique mandate in relation to other democratic mechanisms,including the Government, the legislature, the judiciary and civil society organiza-tions—all of which are part of a national system of protecting and promoting human rights.
33
B. E LEMENTS FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF A
MANDATE ON ECONOMIC ,SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL RIGHTS
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has recognized that national
human rights institutions have a “potentially crucial role” to play in promoting and pro-tecting economic, social and cultural rights. National human rights institutions estab-lished in conformity with the Paris Principles have a unique mandate to work in the areaof human rights. They are official independent organizations established by law, withspecified powers and functions. This gives them status and consequently credibility notenjoyed by either governmental or non-governmental organizations. National humanrights institutions can be catalysts for action and positive change in relation to all hu-man rights, including economic, social and cultural rights.
In its General Comment No.10, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
calls upon States parties to ensure that the mandates of national human rights institu-tions include economic, social and cultural rights. It requests States parties to includedetails of the mandate and relevant activities of national human rights institutions whenpreparing and submitting their periodic reports under the International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights.
General Comment No. 10 sets out the types of activities a national human rights insti-
tution can undertake to protect and promote economic, social and cultural rights:
■Conducting promotional, educational and information programmes;
■Scrutinizing existing laws, draft bills, administrative acts and other proposals for
consistency with economic, social and cultural rights;
■Providing technical advice;
■Identifying national benchmarks for measuring the progressive realization ofeconomic, social and cultural rights;
■Conducting research and inquiries;
■Monitoring compliance with regard to specific rights;
■Examining specific complaints.
Interpreting the mandate
Under the Paris Principles, a national human rights institution must be “vested with
competence to promote and protect human rights”.64The mandate of a national hu-
man rights institution is typically expressed in very general terms. It may refer specifi-cally to certain rights or certain categories of rights but it may also refer to human rightsgenerally. However it is expressed, the mandate must be interpreted by the national hu-man rights institution as it undertakes its work. Interpreting its mandate gives the na-tional institution the opportunity to elaborate its jurisdiction and responsibilities and itsunderstanding of its role and functions. Its understanding and interpretation of its ju-risdiction will inform all its work – its investigations and recommendations, research,monitoring, policy development and advisory roles.
To deal with economic, social and cultural rights, a national human rights institution will
need to consider whether and how its mandate includes those rights and whether andhow its mandate extends to all types of perpetrators of violations of economic, socialand cultural rights.
65
3464Principle 1.
65Support for national human rights institutions having a broad mandate to address economic, social and
cultural rights comes from civil society as well. Organizations such as Forum Asia and, in Canada, theCentre for Equality Rights in Accommodation are challenging national human rights institutions to findways to interpret their mandates creatively.
35ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
4. Mandate of the National Human Rights Commission of India
The National Human Rights Commission of India was created under The Protection
of Human Rights Act 1993. Its mandate is to protect and promote rights guaranteedby the Indian Constitution or embodied in the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights and enforceable in Indian courts.
The Human Rights Commission’s functions include inquiring into alleged violations
of rights, intervening in proceedings before a court, visiting jails, reviewing and com-menting on domestic laws and international instruments, conducting research, re-viewing and commenting on the status of human rights, promoting awareness andeducation and encouraging the involvement of non-governmental organizationsand other institutions.
The Commission has undertaken many inquiries into issues of economic, social and
cultural rights, including in relation to degrading labour, education and mentalhealth facilities. In April 2000, the Commission held a Regional Consultation onPublic Health and Human Rights in New Delhi.
According to general principles of interpretation, human rights should be interpreted
as broadly as possible and restrictions on rights should be interpreted as narrowly aspossible. A national human rights institution should interpret its mandate as widely andcomprehensively as possible, subject to its establishing law and to domestic and inter-national law. In particular, to the extent that the words of the establishing law permit,references to human rights should be interpreted as including all human rights—civil,cultural, economic, political and social.
Economic, social and cultural rights may also come within the mandate of a national
human rights institution through the principle of the indivisibility and interdependenceof all rights. Human rights law is integrated and holistic. Rights relate to each other. Theright to life, for example, has implications for the right to health and the right to edu-cation, and the right to freedom of movement has implications for the right to liveli-hood. Even though a national human rights institution’s mandate may refer only to civiland political rights, it will have jurisdiction to deal with many issues of economic, socialand cultural rights through the rights to life, equality and non-discrimination. 
A national human rights institution’s mandate may also limit its jurisdiction to violations
of rights by certain categories of organization or individual. Most commonly, it mightbe limited to public sector perpetrators, that is, Governments and their officials andagents. The national human rights institution might be able to interpret its jurisdictionto investigate complaints against the State as including any acts by organizations thatare substantially funded, subsidized or regulated by the State. National institutions areencouraged to include in their remit a mandate for the private sector, which is increas-ingly a provider of essential services.
A national human rights institution’s interpretation of its mandate and jurisdiction is
generally subject to judicial review. This should encourage the institution to interpret itsmandate as broadly as possible. It need not and should not be cautious. It can be con-fident that, if it exceeds its legal authority, a court can review its decision and give a de-finitive ruling on the scope of its establishing law.
A national human rights institution’s understanding and interpretation of its jurisdiction
should be communicated clearly, internally and externally, through mission statements,strategic and operational plans, policy guidelines, newsletters, annual and other reportsand other publications, and on its web site. This assists the national institution to actconsistently and in accordance with its developed policy and jurisprudence. It assists thepublic to know how the institution might deal with particular matters. Lastly, it encour-ages the accountability of the national human rights institution for its work
Independence
Independence of a national institution can be assured through legal, operational and 
financial means, democratic and open appointment and dismissal procedures, and well defined, agreed to and consistent processes in the setting of annual financial allo-cations.
A national institution must be able to set its priorities according to a legislatively defined
mandate which could include powers to independently, free from direction by theGovernment, investigate violations of human rights, monitor the observance of humanrights, adopt policies and undertake promotional work. It must also be able to manageits own finances through agreed to budgetary allocations without interference fromvarious government ministries. The ability to set its financial priorities will provide forgreater independence of the institution.
However, this does not mean that a national institution cannot be entirely divorced
from the Government in its operations. Unlike a non-governmental organization, itworks within a mandate prescribed by law. The Government, through the legislature,has a central role in determining the nature and scope of that mandate. In many in-stances – though a more open and transparent selection process is encouraged—theGovernment may have a role in appointing members of the institution. A number of more established national human rights institutions typically have all their membersappointed by the Government, with little or no outside involvement and little trans-parency. 
Recently, however, building on the Paris Principles, the newer generation of institutions
often have far more innovative establishing laws that reduce the Government’s controlover appointments and budgetary allocations, taking into account the importance ofbroad public consultation and the need for financial autonomy of the institution.Similarly institutions are empowered to set their own agendas within broad mandatesto promote and protect human rights.
Functions 
A national human rights institution’s functions as enumerated above should not be
seen as discrete areas of activity but as the elements of an integrated methodologywhere the functions support and inform each other. For example, functions such as re-search, monitoring and policy development can often provide critical information andan analytical framework for the investigation of complaints. At the same time, the re-sults of investigations, including settlements, remedies and any resulting quasi-judicialor judicial decisions, can offer valuable direction for new research and policy develop-ment, legislative reform, and advisory, public education and communication activities.
Powers
A national human rights institution requires the powers necessary to perform its man-
date and functions. This is to be accomplished through either a constitutional or a leg-islative text (generally the legislative text is more comprehensive). The national human
36
37rights institution’s establishing law may give it powers in relation to access to public and
private institutions. It may also provide for investigation of human rights violations. Thepowers may include power to require the production of documents and other evidence,power to compel witnesses to give testimony and power to enter and search premises.The law may also provide for penalties that may be imposed on those who do not com-ply with orders made by the national institution pursuant to these powers.
A national human rights institution will also be given powers of a more administrative
kind relating to its internal management, such as powers to employ staff, to receive andexpend funds, and to acquire premises and other property. These powers are necessaryfor the proper management and functioning of the institution, and also to ensure its independence, and so are indirectly necessary for the operations of the institution to be effective.
Accessibility
An effective national human rights institution is readily accessible to the individuals and
groups whose rights it is established to protect and promote. Accessibility requires thatpeople know of the national institution and its role, that they are able physically tomake contact with it and that they are treated appropriately when they are in contactwith its officers.
A national human rights institution cannot be accessible to a constituency that is igno-
rant of, or ill-informed about, its existence and functions. It should consider creativemeans of making itself visible, including outreach to those most vulnerable groups whoare often difficult to reach and reluctant to voice their concerns to an official body.
Physical accessibility must include access by people living in rural and remote areas. It
may require local offices or regular visits by field officers to ensure a full range of serv-ices and good communications. Accessible facilities, services and information for per-sons with disabilities are also critical and must not be overlooked.
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
5. Uganda Human Rights Commission
The Uganda Human Rights Commission is a statutory body established to protect
and promote human rights. The functions of the Commission are outlined in thecountry’s Constitution and the Human Rights Commission Act No.4 of 1997 and in-clude those of:
◆Establishing a continuing programme of research, education and information to
enhance respect for human rights;
◆Recommending to Parliament effective measures to promote human rights, in-
cluding the provision of compensation to victims of violations of human rights,or their families;
◆Formulating, implementing and overseeing programmes intended to inculcate in
the citizens of Uganda awareness of their civic responsibilities and an apprecia-tion of their rights and obligations as free people.
The Constitution of Uganda contains provisions addressing economic, social and
cultural rights, including the right to education, the right to culture, the right to aclean and healthy environment, and the right to work. The Constitution requires theHuman Rights Commission to develop programmes and activities to promote andprotect those rights.
Appropriate treatment is the third element of accessibility. A national human rights in-
stitution will not be accessible if those whose rights are violated find it unapproachable,unfriendly or difficult to deal with. Working methods and procedures must be appro-priate for victims and potential victims of violations. Services and documents should beprovided in a range of relevant languages. Members and staff of the institution shouldinclude persons drawn from historically marginalized groups, such as women, ethnicand racial minority groups, persons with disabilities and groups whose rights are vio-lated or at risk.
Cooperation
The Paris Principles recognize that an effective national human rights institution will not
function alone but will establish and strengthen cooperative relationships with a widerange of organizations and groups.
National human rights institutions have unique mandates and functions, but they
should exercise them collaboratively in association with other democratic mechanismswith responsibility for the protection and promotion of human rights, including theGovernment, the legislature, the judiciary, the police and the military, and non-govern-mental and civil society organizations, and with individual citizens.
Establishing and maintaining close contact with non-governmental organizations and
civil society is crucial as these groups are involved directly and indirectly in the promo-tion and protection of human rights.
A national human rights institution should also be concerned to work cooperatively,
wherever possible, with local communities and marginalized groups. It should see itsrole as empowering those at most risk of human rights violations with the means toprotect and promote their own rights. Victims and potential victims have the right toparticipate and so should be essential participants in developing and implementing thestrategies, programme and activities of the national human rights institution.
Operational efficiency and capacity
A national human rights institution, it seems, will always have to meet great needs and
demands with limited resources. Like any other organization, it will need to ensure thatits methods of work are as efficient and effective as possible. 
Managing limited resources effectively may require strict setting of priorities and adher-
ence to fixed and approved strategic plans and budgets. A national human rights insti-tution may need to seek external financial and technical support. It will find thatelectronic information and communications technology and resources are essential tooperational efficiency and capacity and so should seek to acquire the best available.
A national human rights institution will need defined working methods and rules of
procedures for matters such as the establishment of working groups, procedures to befollowed for investigating complaints, inquiry and research methodology and the tim-ing and frequency of staff meetings and training. Developing and promoting adherenceto certain methods and procedures will help to maximize operational efficiency. They will also ensure that the most urgent situations receive the speedy attention they require.
Staff must be committed to human rights, knowledgeable, sensitive and skilful in per-
forming their functions. They should be efficient and objective in their work. They willrequire clear job descriptions and fair and effective recruitment, assessment and pro-motion procedures. Both new and established staff will require, and be entitled to,good training. 
38
A national human rights institution should review and evaluate regularly not only its
overall performance but also its structure, management, processes and procedures,specific activities and programmes.
Accountability
Institutional effectiveness requires the development of a system of accountability based
on specific, ascertainable goals. Besides legal and financial accountability to theGovernment and/or Parliament, a national human rights institution also needs to findways to be accountable to those groups and individuals whose rights it is establishedto promote and protect. Its procedures and processes, for example, should be visibleand transparent. Its decision-making processes should be open, rational, consistent andshared. Developing mission and values statements, strategic objectives and plans, staffcodes of ethics, quality service standards and procedural handbooks can be an impor-tant tool for the national human rights institution to ensure, communicate and be ac-countable for high standards of achievement. 
Self and public evaluations of a national human rights institution’s performance, includ-
ing annual reporting on its activities, results and use of its resources, will further con-tribute to the institution’s public accountability. These evaluations should be subject toopen scrutiny, comment and debate.
39
C. C HALLENGES FOR NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS
INSTITUTIONS IN ADDRESSING ECONOMIC ,
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS
A national human rights institution is likely to encounter a number of challenges in ad-
dressing economic, social and cultural rights. It will need to look internally and exter-nally to anticipate and address the obstacles and challenges that may arise.
Internal factors
66
The first challenge facing a national human rights institution may be that of increasing
the level of understanding and acceptance of economic, social and cultural rights
among its members and staff. They may recognize the importance of the indivisibilityand interdependence of all human rights, but be more familiar and experienced in deal-ing with civil and political rights. The national institution will need to develop appropri-ate methodologies and approaches for addressing economic, social and cultural rights,and to allocate priority to their implementation.
Understanding of and commitment to economic, social and cultural rights of them-
selves will be insufficient. A national human rights institution will also require the insti-
tutional capacity to deal with economic, social and cultural rights, and that will be
dependent on the availability of financial resources and staff time. The national institu-tion is likely to have a heavy existing workload and case backlog. Its staff may be insuf-ficiently experienced and trained in the area of economic, social and cultural rights. Theinstitution’s networking with external stakeholders may be undeveloped or ineffective.It may lack management coordination and planning. These are all factors that will chal-lenge the institution’s ability to protect and promote economic, social and culturalrights.
A national human rights institution will need to define standards , including indicators,
benchmarks and targets, relating to economic, social and cultural rights. To monitorthese rights, its staff will require a fuller understanding of the dimensions and parame-ters of each right and the related State obligations.
67International standards, particu-
larly those contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights, will assist them in this. They will need to supplement their skills in investigatingindividual violations with competency in fact-finding, the collection and analysis of pri-mary and secondary data and the analysis of economic, including budgetary, informa-tion.
68
External factors
No national human rights institution can solve all of its country’s human rights problems
on its own. The effectiveness of its work on economic, social and cultural rights will re-quire an external environment that is supportive and enabling—an effective judiciary,
accountable democratic institutions and an engaged and effective civil society. Few, if

any, national human rights institutions will encounter these ideal conditions. A national
institution must therefore remain conscious that the political, economic, social and cul-tural environment can inhibit its operating independently and effectively, and obstructits work for economic, social and cultural rights. The national human rights institutionshould consider:
■The level of judicial capacity and independence and their impact on its ability tofunction;
■The domestic legislative framework for and international treaty obligations relatingto the enforcement of remedies;
■Strategies to reduce risks that it will be drawn into party political conflicts;
■Steps to educate the public and civil society about its mandate;
■How to sensitize the Government, the military and the police to its role andauthority.
Societies with recent histories of gross violations of human rights, or where societal
transformation is occurring, may also be struggling with a culture of impunity in whichindividuals consider themselves to be above the law.
69A national human rights institu-
tion in this kind of society will need to advocate respect by all individuals for the coun-try’s democratic institutions, including the national institution itself.
A national human rights institution may also face conflicting interpretations of human
rights, and challenges to the notion of the universality of all rights. In a State that hasnot yet ratified the key international human rights treaties, the national institution willgive priority to promoting the ratification of treaties and their incorporation in domes-tic law. Indeed, a restrictive interpretation of human rights may also affect theGovernment’s interpretation of the national institution’s mandate, excluding the insti-tution from addressing economic, social and cultural rights issues.
A national human rights institution may also need to address in its promotional activi-
ties misconceptions , lack of awareness and shared misunderstanding among the pub-
lic, government officials and even the judiciary about the specific nature of economic,social and cultural rights and the State’s obligation to respect, protect and fulfil theserights. It may encounter a public and institutional attitude that access to food, housing,employment and education are welfare issues rather human rights issues, or that eco-nomic, social and cultural issues are aspirational rather than legal. The realization ofeconomic, social and cultural rights may be viewed as unrealistically expensive.
Public opinion may not accept that there is any deficiency in a country’s performance of
its obligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights. The relatively well off seg-ment of society, whether the majority of the population or not, may lack interest in orbe prejudiced against marginalized individuals and groups. This segment of society hasa disproportionate effect on the public expression of views and disproportionate influ-ence on Governments. Business competition, consumerism and the mass media cancontribute to public apathy concerning economic, social and cultural rights.
Even where there is good government and public appreciation of economic, social and
cultural rights and obligations, the national human rights institution may encounter dif-ficulty in promoting and protecting them. For example, the State may lack resources to
address economic, social and cultural rights issues. The national human rights institu-tion will need to understand the legal nature of the progressive realization of economic,

social and cultural rights and the implications of obligations concerning these rights for
government decision-making about budgets, revenue raising and public expenditure,and inform itself of the Government’s available resources and be in a position to discussthis subject with it.
In addition, legal and judicial gaps may still inhibit the full realization of economic, so-
cial and cultural rights.
70Courts may not consider economic, social and cultural rights
and social conditions relevant to cases before them. Even when these rights are consid-ered justiciable, the courts may be unwilling to uphold the spirit and intent of the lawin addition to the letter. Moreover, courts are often physically far from the people whoneed them the most, and where they are not, access to the legal system is usually moresuccessful for the wealthy than the poor. The system may fail to deliver justice becauseof corruption. Low expectations and poor actual results from the courts will affect thepublic’s confidence in and use of the system, particularly those whose economic, socialand cultural rights are being violated and who are in need of protection.

III. THE ROLE OF
NATIONAL HUMANRIGHTS INSTITUTIONSIN PROTECTING ANDPROMOTINGECONOMIC, SOCIAL
AND CULTURAL RIGHTS
43
To work effectively in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, a national human
rights institution must have a comprehensive understanding of:
■The international and domestic legal framework for economic, social and culturalrights;
■The issues affecting economic, social and cultural rights in its own country; 
■The work of others involved in protecting and promoting economic, social andcultural rights in the country.
Given the complexity of economic, social and cultural rights, the activities undertaken
should also be based on a strategic approach that takes into consideration both the op-portunities and constraints facing the institution. 
Many of the strategies and approaches a national human rights institution uses to pro-
mote and protect civil and political rights will be equally applicable to promoting andprotecting economic, social and cultural rights. Indeed, work in these areas should nottake place in isolation, but should be complementary and integrated. The national in-stitution should strive to develop an integrated approach in its work on all humanrights, including economic, social and cultural rights, ensuring that its strategies reflectthe indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and that work in one area is co-ordinated with and informed by what is taking place in others.
A national human rights institution need not develop entirely new procedures for eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights. The functions it performs and the strategies it employsshould be mutually supporting. The results of investigations should be incorporated inmonitoring activities and monitoring should identify new issues and cases that requireintensive investigation. Similarly, the results of investigations and monitoring may influ-ence the content of promotional campaigns, community outreach and education pro-grammes. Promotional and outreach activities, in turn, will identify cases and issues forinvestigation and monitoring.

A. D EALING WITH VIOLATIONS OF ECONOMIC ,SOCIAL
AND CULTURAL RIGHTS
In this section of the handbook, ways in which a national human rights institution can
protect and promote economic, social and cultural rights are discussed. Why a nationalhuman rights institution should deal with violations of economic, social and culturalrights is briefly explored, essential principles to guide the institution’s work are exam-ined and elements of a framework for the investigation of violations of economic, so-cial and cultural rights are elaborated.
Why deal with violations of economic, social and cultural rights?
Human rights are indivisible and interdependent. If a national human rights institution
is to affirm through its operations this fundamental principle of international humanrights law, then it must find ways to protect and promote economic, social and culturalrights, and not only civil and political rights.
71It should reflect the totality of human
rights in its work. 
Violations of human rights can be either individually based or system based. The two
types of violation require different remedial approaches. An individual violation affectsone person or a small number of persons and is often perpetrated by one or a smallnumber of individuals. Economic, social and cultural rights are generally more often thesubject of systemic violations. Systemic violations have broad causes and effects, oftenarising from the ways in which society is organized politically, socially and economically.It is often difficult to identify individual perpetrators who bear individual responsibilityfor systemic violations. The State as a whole will be responsible. 
Economic, social and cultural rights are violated in all States, at least to some degree.
Where these violations occur, they are often on a large scale and committed with a highdegree and expectation of impunity.
72General Comment No.10 of the Committee on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights sets out activities that a national human rights in-stitution can undertake to protect and promote economic, social and cultural rights, in-cluding conducting inquiries and examining specific complaints. An effectivemechanism for investigating economic, social and cultural rights complaints can bothhold perpetrators accountable for their actions and deter potential violators from initi-ating new violations.
73
Courts are the basic mechanism for the protection of human rights. They act judicially,according to fixed rules of procedure and evidence, make binding decisions on casesand impose enforceable remedies and sanctions. But there are limitations on courts’ability to protect human rights. Their powers and roles vary from one judicial system toanother. Courts generally have no, or only limited, powers of investigation, dependupon matters being brought before them, have no independent research capacity andcan provide remedies only within a limited range. National human rights institutions,

International Law, Washington, D.C., 1994), p. 427.
72Maastricht guideline 27 asserts: " Impunity . States should develop effective measures to preclude the
possibility of impunity of any violation of economic, social and cultural rights and to ensure that no personwho may be responsible for violations of such rights has immunity from liability for their actions."
73See United Nations, A Handbook on the Establishment and Strengthening of National Human Rights
Institutions …, paras. 216-297.
therefore, can supplement the role of the courts and play a significant role in removing
impunity and deterring violations.
Because all human rights are interdependent, effective investigative responses to viola-
tions of economic, social and cultural rights will also prevent many violations of civil andpolitical rights. The investigation of alleged human rights violations is an importantfunction of many national human rights institutions.
74The Paris Principles do not re-
quire that a national human rights institution have this function, but they contain spe-cial provisions dealing with investigation for those institutions that do. This function willusually carry with it discretion to determine the admissibility of complaints, formal pow-ers of investigation, including search for and production of evidence and summoningof witnesses, and power to make recommendations, including as to remedies, and tofollow up and monitor the implementation of the recommendations. It will generally in-clude the receipt of complaints concerning individual violations and will often also in-clude the investigation of systemic violations.
A national human rights institution has a distinctive role which complements that of the
courts in dealing with human rights violations. It can deal with complaints, as well asinitiating action on its own motion. It can recommend innovative and far-reachingremedies to address not only the particular circumstances of individual victims of hu-man rights violations but also the broader systemic causes and consequences of the vi-olations, acting to prevent further violations and not only to rectify past violations.Moreover, a national human rights institution has a particular focus on human rightsand develops expertise in this area that most courts do not and cannot acquire. Thecomplementary role of a national human rights institution is particularly important foreconomic, social and cultural rights because most courts traditionally have been unableto offer effective protection against, and remedies for, violations of these kinds of hu-man rights.
Unlike a non-governmental organization, a national human rights institution is subject
to the law that establishes it and is therefore restricted by its establishing legislation.Sometimes this law does not give it jurisdiction to handle cases of violation of rights.Sometimes it restricts the case-handling jurisdiction to certain specified rights or certainspecified groups of rights, such as civil and political rights. However, most national hu-man rights institutions have some discretion in interpreting and implementing theirmandate and most deal with economic, social and cultural rights in one way or another.Where certain provisions of a national human rights institution’s statute appear to limitits ability to investigate economic, social and cultural rights, the institution has often in-terpreted other provisions to allow this work. Some institutions have sought amend-ments to their legislation to include economic, social and cultural rights specificallywithin their mandates. In these ways, national human rights institutions have showntheir commitment to dealing with human rights holistically.
The experiences of many national human rights institutions demonstrate that dealing
with complaints is a very time-consuming and resource-intensive activity. Often thecomplaint load will stretch the capacity of a national institution to respond, even if it iswell resourced. The National Human Rights Commission of India, for example, is one ofthe larger institutions, with almost 300 staff positions, but it received 40,724 new com-plaints in 1998/99, the latest year publicly reported upon. If it is to deal successfully withheavy complaint loads, a national human rights institution must develop mechanismsand strategies that will enable it to respond in a timely and effective manner to the fullrange of human rights complaints. It should offer accessible, rapid, effective and inex-pensive resolution of a matter.

47Investigative principles
All investigations of human rights violations should be based on firm principles for
sound practice.75This relates to investigations into violations of economic, social and
cultural rights, as well as violations of civil and political rights. It requires strong institu-tional commitment. These principles are:
76
Accuracy and objectivity . Investigations must be objective, thorough and accurate. The
reliability and credibility of information collected and disseminated should be ensuredby seeking direct evidence and corroboration. 
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
6. Investigative monitoring in the Philippines
The 1987 Philippines Constitution stipulates that the Philippine Commission on
Human Rights shall function “to investigate … all forms of human rights violationsinvolving civil and political rights” and shall “monitor the Philippine Government’scompliance with international treaty obligations on human rights”. A SupremeCourt ruling of 5 January 1994
77confirmed that the Philippine Commission on
Human Rights could only investigate civil and political rights violations. This decisionled the Commission to look for other ways to include economic, social and culturalrights within the framework and limits of its jurisdiction. 
Because of the large number of complaints received by the Commission concerning
alleged violations of economic, social and cultural rights, the Commission developeda system of “investigative monitoring” of economic, social and cultural rights basedon the constitutional requirement that it monitor government compliance withinternational treaty obligations. The Philippines ratified the International Covenanton Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1974 and so obligations under that treatywere included in the Commission’s constitutional mandate. The Commission hasattempted to implement its investigative monitoring function through thedevelopment of the Philippine Human Rights Plan, which identifies administrative,programme and legislative measures to address the needs of 16 vulnerable sectorsin Philippine society. The Commission has also placed considerable emphasis onmonitoring forced evictions and the violations of human rights resulting from thatpractice.
78
Timeliness . Investigations should be carried out in a timely manner. Long delays may re-
sult in a complainant or respondent being denied justice.
Diversity of information . Attempts should be made to use as many sources of informa-
tion as possible in investigations. All the available evidence should be collected and eval-uated.

on Human Rights, 1999).
Adherence to human rights standards . Human rights investigations require that the 
relevant international and domestic human rights standards be used as points of refer-ence when collecting and analysing the information available. When investigating casesinvolving economic, social and cultural rights, national human rights institution staffand members will need to develop a thorough understanding of the relevant State obligations.
Respect for all parties. Investigations should be carried out in an atmosphere of the ut-
most respect for all those concerned. Additional special consideration may be requiredwhen dealing with victims of a traumatic experience. Persons accused of violating hu-man rights are entitled to the presumption of innocence. 
A complaints-based framework for dealing with violations of economic,
social and cultural rights
Implementing these principles requires the development and consistent application of
procedures to deal effectively and fairly with complaints involving economic, social andcultural rights.
The procedures should ensure accurate, accessible public information about the na-
tional human rights institution’s jurisdiction and processes:
■What types of complaints it can investigate and what limits it may have under itsjurisdiction?
■What is required to file a complaint?
■What to expect once a complaint has been made, including what procedures willbe followed in processing complaints and undertaking investigations and howdecisions and recommendations will be made?
■What is required to respond to a complaint?
■What criteria are applied to determine priority in handling emergency cases where,for example, a complainant’s life may be in danger?
■What the possible remedies are if a violation is established.
A national human rights institution should be prepared to use investigative powers , in
particular to compel the presence of witnesses and the production of evidence, if nec-essary to obtain all the relevant information. Transparent and impartial investigationmechanisms and the judicious use of its powers will help a national human rights insti-tution comply with the principles for investigation. They will also increase the prospectsof an effective resolution of the complaint by increasing the confidence in, and respectfor, the institution and its processes of all parties concerned—the Government, thepublic, the victims and the violators.
Public reporting on the results of investigations ensures that perpetrators are made ac-
countable, victims are recognized and supported, and the transparency of the processis maintained. It allows others to see that the investigations are thorough and impartial.This does not mean that the public need know all the details of every case. In some sit-uations, the complainant’s right to privacy may require that names and other identify-ing details not be disclosed.
Different investigative approaches may be necessary in handling violations that are sys-
temic rather than individual. In these cases, investigations and recommendationsshould encompass more than the particulars of specific cases. They should focus on theroot causes of a situation. The national human rights institution will seek to identifyways in which past violations can be remedied and new violations of a similar kind pre-vented. It may make recommendations that affect government legislation, policy and
48
programmes and, as a result, budgetary priorities. Dealing with complaints on a sys-
temic basis also assists the national institution in handling its complaint load, as com-plaints raising similar issues are dealt with jointly. The same principles apply in thisbroader investigation, but the procedures used may be quite different.
The steps in investigating individual violations
Generally speaking, the investigation of alleged individual violations of economic, so-
cial and cultural rights can begin in one of two ways. First and most commonly, the na-tional human rights institution receives a complaint alleging a human rights violation.The complaint may come from a victim or victims. It may also be made by a third party,such as a family member or neighbour or a human rights defender—either an individ-ual activist or a non-governmental organization. Sometimes the law establishing thenational human rights institution may restrict its jurisdiction to complaints made by vic-tims. Victims are often unable to lodge complaints themselves. They may be unablephysically to do so, for example because they have been detained or even killed. Theymay be frightened to do so because of threats and intimidation by perpetrators or oth-ers. They may lack the confidence to do so and be generally disadvantaged because ofpoverty or poor education. The power to accept third party complaints, therefore, is im-portant in order to ensure that serious violations do not fall outside the jurisdiction ofthe national human rights institution.
Secondly, a national human rights institution may have the power to initiate an investi-
gation itself ( suo moto ) into a matter within its jurisdiction that comes to its attention.
This power provides an excellent opportunity for national institutions to promote eco-nomic, social and cultural rights. Victims of violations of economic, social and culturalrights tend, on the whole, to be economically and socially disadvantaged and so theleast likely to seek redress for violations of their rights. The power to initiate investiga-tions can help the national institution meet the needs of individuals or communitieswho may not otherwise be heard.
Each national human rights institution must develop its own procedures for receiving
and handling complaints that are consistent with its statute, reflect its mandate and itscontext and conform to international human rights standards. The practices of nationalinstitutions generally reveal a few steps that constitute a common framework for inves-tigation once an institution has received a complaint:
1. Determine the admissibility of the complaint1.
■Identify the issues raised by the allegation;
1.■Assess whether the allegation falls within the jurisdiction of the national
human rights institution;
1.■Assess whether the allegation, if proven, would constitute a violation of
domestic and international human rights standards.
2. Investigate1.
■Develop a plan, or terms of reference, to conduct an investigation; 
1.■Conduct an investigation following established procedures and princi-
ples;
1.■Record the findings.
3. Conciliate1.
■Where appropriate, assist the complainant and respondent to reach a
private settlement of the issue acceptable to both.
49
4. Make a determination on the complaint
1.■Analyse the information obtained during the course of the investiga-
tion;
1.■Make findings and recommendations.
5. Follow up1.
■Inform all parties of the findings and recommendations;
1.■Monitor implementation of recommendations.
Determining the admissibility of a complaint 
In most ways, the investigation of alleged violations of economic, social and cultural
rights will follow the same pattern as in cases involving civil and political rights.However, a national human rights institution may confront particular challenges whenit comes to determining the admissibility of a complaint concerning economic, socialand cultural rights.
One of those challenges relates to the jurisdiction of the particular national human
rights institution. The first admissibility issue is whether the allegations fall within theinstitution’s jurisdiction under its establishing legislation. As already discussed, a na-tional human rights institution may have to use its discretion in interpreting and imple-menting its legislative mandate to accept a complaint of a violation of economic, socialand cultural rights. The legal issue may not be as clear as in the case of civil and politi-cal rights, where there may be a specific legislative mandate. One way to address theissue is through the permeability principle , by which civil and political rights are used as
the basis for admitting complaints concerning economic, social and cultural rights. Forexample, an allegation based on the inaccessibility of health care might be admitted asa possible infringement of the right to life. The Supreme Court of India has made manydecisions about the content of the right to life similar to this.
The second admissibility issue is whether the allegations, if proved, would constitute a
violation of domestic and international human rights standards. In addressing this issue,national human rights institutions can use instructive tools, such as the MaastrichtGuidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the general com-ments prepared by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Maastrichtguidelines 14 and 15, for example, outline specific acts of commission, such as theadoption of deliberately regressive measures (14 (e)), and omission, such as the failureto reform or repeal legislation manifestly inconsistent with an obligation of theCovenant (15 (b)), that would constitute violations of economic, social and culturalrights by the State or other entities.
79Formulating allegations in the language of the
Maastricht Guidelines or of the Committee’s general comments helps to determine ad-missibility and later to establish the investigation plan, case analysis and recommenda-tions on a solid basis of legal jurisprudence and interpretative policy. 
There are also a number of technical requirements for admissibility. The complaint must
either identify the alleged perpetrator or perpetrators and the victims or victims or pro-vide sufficient information to assist the national human rights institution to make thenecessary identification in the course of its investigation. It must contain particulars ofwhen, where and how the alleged violation occurred. It must permit identification ofthe human rights obligation alleged to have been violated, at least in general terms, ifthe exact nature of an allegedly unmet obligation is not articulated. For example, a ru-ral community that does not have access to safe and potable water alleges that the
5079See annex for the full text of the Maastricht Guidelines.
State failed to take steps to ensure access (General Comment No.14 on the right to
health, para.11). When determining admissibility the national human rights institutionmight not know what particular steps the State allegedly failed to take or what acts ofcommission or omission the State might have engaged in. Investigation and analysiswould be required for this. Here the national human rights institution could determineadmissibility on the basis of the fact that water is not available and the allegation thatthe State is responsible. 
Investigating
All investigations should proceed on the basis of a developed plan or terms of reference.
The plan should identify the critical human rights issues raised by the allegations. Thesewill be the issues that need to be addressed in the process of investigation and later de-termination of the complaint.
The initial complaint should be examined carefully to identify:
■What issues require verification and how that verification will be effected?
■What information needs to be obtained and how that will be done?
■What gaps there are in the evidence and how they will be addressed?
■What witnesses need to be interviewed and where they are.
In investigating violations of economic, social and cultural rights, the national human
rights institution might need to identify benchmarks for the observance of these rightsand for the performance of State obligations. It may also need to collect data about sit-uations within the State at the national and regional levels. Comparative data may beimportant in determining whether rights have been violated. These issues are furtherdiscussed below.
The investigation process should proceed in accordance with the principles of investi-
gation already outlined. It should conform to relevant international human rights stan-dards, including those for the investigation of criminal offences.
The course of the investigation and the information obtained during the investigation
should be carefully recorded. National human rights institutions should perform theirfunctions transparently and accountably. Care must be taken to ensure that material ev-idence is collected and protected and that witnesses are safe from intimidation andharm.
Conciliating
Some national human rights institutions are required by their establishing legislation to
attempt to conciliate complaints of human rights violations. Even when not so required,a national institution might seek to conciliate complaints. There are many good reasonsfor attempting conciliation. Conciliation may provide a remedy for the victim more eas-ily and less traumatically than a court procedure. With their rules, procedures and for-mality, court processes may be intimidating to many people. They may also beexpensive—beyond the resources of the poor who are the principal victims of violationsof economic, social and cultural rights. The national human rights institution offers amore flexible, less expensive and less formal alternative, which can achieve a good re-sult for a victim through conciliation.
It is important that a national human rights institution ensures that the effects of any
inequality in power or resources between the parties are minimized in the conciliationprocess and that the victim is not disadvantaged because of her or his inequality. Thismay require the institution to provide legal and other support to the complainant or at
51
least to ensure that the complainant has access to such support. The national institu-
tion has a particular responsibility to ensure that the complainant is not subjected tophysical or other improper pressure to force acceptance of a settlement that she or heconsiders unjust or otherwise does not want.
Conciliation is not always appropriate. Some allegations of human rights violation are
so serious that nothing short of a full criminal trial is appropriate. Victims are entitled toredress, including compensation, for the violation of their rights and the injury donethem, but perpetrators should not escape accountability for their actions. Conciliationmust not be used as a means to impunity.
Conciliation with one or a small number of victims will also be inappropriate as a full
resolution of a complaint that raises wide systemic issues. Again, national human rightsinstitutions must be careful to avoid being used by perpetrators to avoid their respon-sibilities. In assisting with the conciliation of complaints, a national institution shouldlook to promote not only justice for individual victims but also systemic change that willboth assist other victims not party to the complaint and prevent further violations. Manynational human rights institutions have excellent experience in achieving conciliatedsettlements that both provide redress for the individual complainant and address sys-temic issues raised by the complaint.
Making a determination on the complaint
In preparing the case analysis and their recommendations, national human rights insti-
tutions must establish precisely which acts or failures to act by the State or other rele-vant actors actually constitute violations of economic, social and cultural rights.National human rights institutions must have a firm understanding of the national con-text in which the complaint arises, the nature of the State’s obligations relating to eco-nomic, social and cultural rights and the benchmarks attributed to the enjoyment of theright in the particular country. They must be able to apply these standards to real cases.Again, tools such as the Maastricht Guidelines and general comments of theCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are particularly valuable. 
In determining the nature of State obligations, national human rights institutions will
need to assess whether a situation is a result of the State’s unwillingness to comply withits obligations rather than its inability to do so. The Maastricht Guidelines concede thata State has a certain “margin of discretion” to determine the best manner of imple-menting its obligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights, depending onlocal conditions.
80However, when accounting for its performance, the State must es-
tablish that its failure to comply with its obligations immediately and in full is due to in-ability rather than its unwillingness to do so. For instance, Maastricht guideline 13asserts:
5280Margin of discretion: As in the case of civil and political rights, States enjoy a margin of discretion in
selecting the means for implementing their respective obligations. State practice and the application oflegal norms to concrete cases and situations by international treaty monitoring bodies as well as bydomestic courts have contributed to the development of universal minimum standards and the commonunderstanding of the scope, nature and limitation of economic, social and cultural rights. The fact thatthe full realization of most economic, social and cultural rights can only be achieved progressively, whichin fact also applies to most civil and political rights, does not alter the nature of the legal obligation ofStates, which requires that certain steps be taken immediately and others as soon as possible. Therefore,the burden is on the State to demonstrate that it is making measurable progress toward the full realizationof the rights in question. The State cannot use the "progressive realization" provisions in article 2 of theCovenant as a pretext for non-compliance. Nor can the State justify derogations or limitations of rightsrecognized in the Covenant because of different social, religious and cultural backgrounds. (Maastrichtguideline 8)
In determining which actions or omissions amount to a violation of an economic,
social or cultural right, it is important to distinguish the inability from the unwil-lingness of a State to comply with its treaty obligations. A State claiming that it isunable to carry out its obligation for reasons beyond its control has the burden ofproving that this is the case. A temporary closure of an educational institution dueto an earthquake, for instance, would be a circumstance beyond the control ofthe State, while the elimination of a social security scheme without an adequatereplacement programme could be an example of unwillingness by the State to ful-fil its obligations.
Once a national human rights institution has determined that there has been a viola-
tion of economic, social and cultural rights, it should consider the range of remediesavailable both to redress the violation and to prevent future violations. These might in-clude recommending compensation for identified victims, changes to governmentlaws, policies and programmes or the development and implementation of new laws,policies and programmes, and alterations to or the provision of public facilities and in-frastructure. The national institution can pursue appropriate remedies through a varietyof quite different means. It can offer or arrange mediation and dispute resolution be-tween the parties to seek an individual settlement. It can organize or facilitate class ac-tion suits in the courts. It can consider exercising any power it may have to issueenforceable orders. It can make recommendations or referrals to other authorities, suchas a tribunal or court. It can also undertake its own process of further monitoring or in-vestigation. Whatever course it takes, the national institution should seek remedies thathave both individual and systemic elements, in order to protect both personal and pub-lic interests.
Follow-up
National human rights institutions should make public the findings and recommenda-
tions that result from their investigations, with appropriate safeguards for the privacyof victims. They should pursue the implementation of the recommendations, keepingthe parties informed of their efforts. National human rights institutions are continuingbodies. They are not appointed for a specific investigation and then cease to exist, asmany commissions of inquiry do. They do not lose jurisdiction when they have disposedof a complaint, as courts do. As continuing bodies, they have the ability and power tomonitor the implementation of recommendations arising from their investigations.They might choose to do this formally over time and report publicly again on the result.Public reporting will strengthen recommendations and encourage future cooperationwith the institution by establishing its determination to pursue implementation and en-hancing its credibility. It will also communicate a strong message that the institution iswilling and able to address economic, social and cultural rights, that individuals andgroups are encouraged to bring forward complaints and that there are consequencesfor those who violate these rights.
A national human rights institution can make use of its investigations of alleged viola-
tions of economic, social and cultural rights in its programmes to promote awarenessof and respect for these rights. It can use them to promote understanding of the inter-dependence and indivisibility of all human rights. A successful resolution of a case, par-ticularly one that has resulted in a judicial order or an appropriate settlement by theparties, can be used to raise awareness and educate the community generally.

54ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
7. Ontario Human Rights Commission, Canada
The Ontario Human Rights Commission in Canada received a complaint from a
woman who alleged she was refused service in a restaurant while breastfeeding herchild and ordered to leave the premises. The Commission sent the case to a tribu-nal, where it was settled in favour of the complainant. 
As a result of the complaint and the settlement, in October 2000 the Commission
launched a province-wide campaign in partnership with the Infant Feeding ActionCoalition Canada and the Toronto Public Health Unit to mark World BreastfeedingWeek. The campaign featured an advertisement that was placed on municipal tran-sit vehicles across the province, promoting a woman’s right to breastfeed her childin public.
The advertising campaign was part of the Commission’s work to protect women
from discrimination in services and employment during pregnancy and breastfeed-ing. It affirmed the work of other international organizations, such as UNICEF andthe World Health Organization that have repeatedly promoted the health and socialbenefits of breastfeeding.
The Commission also revised its Policy on Discrimination because of Pregnancy to in-
clude the right to breastfeed in public and in the work environment.
Although the complaint concerned discrimination rather than economic, social and
cultural rights, this is a good example of how complaint handling can influenceother national human rights institution functions, such as policy development,awareness raising and public education.
Investigating systemic violations
Systemic violations affect whole groups of people, sometimes within one region or lo-
cality, or even across a whole State or many States. Although it may be possible to iden-tify those who share responsibility for the violations and hold them accountable, thecauses of the violations are embedded in broader social, economic and political struc-tures and systems. The investigation of these kinds of complaints is difficult because itmust go beyond the experiences of victims to an analysis of the structures and function-ing of the society as a whole in order to identify what is producing the violations andhow they can be addressed and prevented.
Hearing the experiences of victims is an essential part of the investigation process.
Victims must be able to tell their stories, have them acknowledged and receive the nec-essary affirmation. Systemic violations, however, by their very nature also require sys-temic responses. Here the work of the national human rights institution must be of ahigh professional quality. The national institution has the responsibility to identifycauses and to propose solutions. It should not expect that it will possess all the neces-sary expertise. Rather it should seek to tap the best available expertise, advice and as-sistance from government agencies, universities, non-governmental organizations andthe private sector. In the end, however, it must make its own findings and recommen-dations. Therefore, in dealing with systemic violations, a institution must ensure thatpeople are at the centre of its concern, while assessing the underpinning structural, so-cial and economic factors which permit systemic violations.
The various steps in investigating individual complaints may also be relevant to the in-
vestigation of systemic violations, although other more effective strategies with regard
to systemic violations have also been developed. Some national human rights institu-
tions have adopted a process of public inquiry as an effective means of undertakingwide-ranging investigations into systemic violations of economic, social and culturalrights. Issues for inquiry may have arisen out of investigation, monitoring, research orother consultation activities of the national institution. The inquiry process, which canbe lengthy and requires strong and concerted commitment, includes extensive researchand private consultation. Its most distinctive element is the conducting of public hear-ings.
At these hearings victims are invited to speak publicly about their experiences. It may
be necessary to take steps to ensure that witnesses are protected both from any possi-bility of retribution and from public embarrassment, for example by suppressing theirnames and other identifying information. The legislation establishing a national humanrights institution will often give it power to make orders concerning confidentiality orany other matter in relation to witnesses and information provided during the courseof investigation. The legislation may also provide criminal penalties for breaches of suchorders. These powers should where necessary be used appropriately in order to ensurethat witnesses are protected and are not discouraged from giving their evidencethrough fear of the consequences.
In public hearings, the national human rights institution will also take evidence from
government officials, academic experts, non-governmental organizations and other hu-man rights advocates, and any other organizations and individuals with informationthat can assist the inquiry. The national institution can examine these witnesses, testingtheir evidence and opinions. This in itself is an important step in promoting and protect-ing human rights. It makes government officials and others publicly accountable fortheir actions, opinions and proposals. It demonstrates to the community that these of-ficials are not above the law, but answerable at least to those charged under the lawwith responsibility for human rights.
The community education dimension of public hearings is important. This approach to
investigating systemic violations is an opportunity for public education and awarenessbuilding. By presenting real situations of human rights violations in public forums, thenational human rights institution gives substance and content to human rights law inthe specific context of the particular State. The community becomes more aware ofwhat human rights are and what the human rights situation in the country is. Theprocess not only uncovers facts about violations, it also builds a public demand for andexpectation of change that will support implementation of the recommendations madeat the conclusion of the investigation.
The final steps in this process are the development of the report of the investigation and
the recommendations of the national human rights institution and their presentation tothe Government, the legislature and the public. Because systemic violations of eco-nomic, social and cultural rights can be affected by both public and private agenciesand by both organizations and individuals, the national institution should be able to di-rect its recommendations to any appropriate organization or person. It should not berestricted to addressing only the Government or other State institutions. The report andrecommendations should deal comprehensively with the issues raised in the investiga-tion and address them as effectively as possible.
If the public inquiry process is to be fully effective, its results should be publicly avail-
able, with appropriate safeguards for witnesses where necessary. This not only ensurestransparency in the work of the national human rights institution, but also promotesthe public accountability of the Government and others to whom recommendations aredirected. When the recommendations are known, those to whom they are directed willbe expected to respond publicly and report publicly on steps they have taken in re-
55
56sponse. In this way, the implementation of the recommendations becomes a public
concern. The national human rights institution should monitor implementation of therecommendations and report regularly on them.
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
8. Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has a well devel-
oped practice of public inquiry into systemic violations of human rights, especiallyeconomic, social and cultural rights. These inquiries began soon after theCommission was established in 1986. They have employed the various componentsdiscussed in this section
The first such public inquiry concerned the rights of homeless children. In its 1989
report Our Homeless Children: Report of the National Inquiry into Homeless
Children , the Commission made a series of detailed recommendations to the na-
tional and state governments of Australia and to private and community sector or-ganizations. The Commission recommended that “where children and youngpeople leave or ought to leave home because of serious neglect or abuse, theCommonwealth should meet the obligation to support them, regardless of theirage, in conditions where they are protected and can develop as required by theDeclaration of the Rights of the Child”. The report raised community awareness ofchild homelessness as a human rights issue and raised public expectations of moreeffective government action to address the needs of the children concerned. It re-sulted in fundamental changes in policy and increases in public expenditure on chil-dren’s rights issues.

The Australian Commission has conducted many other public inquiries, including in-quiries into human rights and mental illness, access to safe and reliable water in re-mote indigenous communities, health services for remote indigenous communities,racist violence, rural and remote school education, and the employment of pregnantwomen. These inquiries are good examples of the usefulness of this approach to in-vestigating systemic violations of economic, social and cultural rights.

B. M ONITORING ECONOMIC ,SOCIAL AND CULTURAL
RIGHTS
Monitoring is the process of systematically tracking and assessing State performance
against clear benchmarks and targets. It requires, first and foremost, data collection andanalysis, involving not only official statistics, but possibly also field observation and in-vestigations or even fact-finding delegations. It needs to draw on diverse sources of in-formation, including studies and standards, both domestic and international, relatingto violations or progressive change in the status of economic, social and culturalrights.
82Monitoring these rights requires looking at qualitative and quantitative meas-
ures or indicators to assess what movement there has been from key benchmarks es-tablished at the start the monitoring period and whether targets set at that time havebeen met.
Why monitor economic, social and cultural rights?
A State’s performance of its human rights obligations must be monitored to ensure that
the obligations are met. This is recognized by each of the key human rights treaties,which have established treaty committees for this purpose and require States to reportperiodically to these committees. Monitoring performance with regard to obligationsrelating to economic, social and cultural rights is especially important. International lawrecognizes that, because of resource limitations, States may not be able to ensure im-mediately that all their citizens fully enjoy all their economic, social and cultural rights.The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and theConvention on the Rights of the Child both provide for progressive realization of eco-nomic, social and cultural rights. If the obligation of progressive realization is to betaken seriously, each State’s performance must be monitored.
Monitoring the performance of obligations relating to economic, social and cultural
rights achieves many important results:
■It indicates whether a State is meeting its obligations and provides a basis forholding the State accountable.
■It shows where the State is meeting its obligations and where it falls short.
■It can identify the source and nature of violations, and problems in realizingeconomic, social and cultural rights.
■It can identify priorities for action and suggest where resources need to beallocated.
■It can support legislative advocacy and policy formulation, as well as publicawareness and education campaigns.
■It can promote principled policy-making that incorporates a human rightsperspective, and processes that facilitate public accountability.
■It can also be used to pursue actions to obtain remedies.
■It provides the basis for reports and submissions to national or international bodies.
A national human rights institution, as an official human rights organization, is well
equipped to undertake this monitoring. In its General Comment No.10 on the role of na-tional human rights institutions, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rightsemphasizes that monitoring States’ compliance with their obligations in relation to spe-
5782Manuel Guzman and Bert Verstappen, What is Monitoring? Human Rights Monitoring and
Documentation Series , vol. 1 (Versoix, Switzerland, Human Rights Information and Documentation
Systems International, 2001) (www.huridocs.org).
cific rights is an important activity of national institutions in the protection and promo-
tion of economic, social and cultural rights. Monitoring can be at the core of a compre-hensive approach to addressing economic, social, cultural and other rights that involvesa variety of functions, activities and strategies. The results of monitoring can provide cru-cial information and analysis to support the other functions of the national human rightsinstitution, particularly systemic investigations, advisory statements or recommenda-tions, and educational activities promoting economic, social, cultural and other rights.Monitoring economic, social and cultural rights is a promotional activity in itself.
Principles
A number of key principles should form the basis for monitoring effectively the per-
formance of State obligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights. Theseprinciples should guide a national human rights institution when it is collecting and as-sessing information.
As with investigations of human rights complaints, the process of monitoring must be
thorough, accurate and impartial and must be perceived as such. Because the results
must be credible and reliable, the national human rights institution should draw infor-mation for corroboration from as many sources as possible, including statistical data,research studies and reports by the Government, non-governmental organizations, ac-ademics and international bodies. The scope of the information to be collected and thecategories and terminology to be used should be defined. Systematic recording meth-ods and sound data storage and retrieval are also important.
83
A gender perspective should be an integral part of the design and implementation of
monitoring activities in order to recognize and address the different experiences ofwomen and men in relation to economic, social and cultural rights.

9. South African Human Rights Commission84
The South African Human Rights Commission was established in 1995 in accor-
dance with the provisions of the 1993 Interim Constitution and the Human RightsCommission Act 1994. Section 184 (3) of the Constitution places a duty on theHuman Rights Commission to require State organs to report on “measures theyhave taken towards the realization of the rights … concerning housing, health care,food, water, social security, education and the environment”. This obligation suggests that the information the Commission receives should form the basis of a report. 
In preparing its six-volume 1997-1998 Economic and Social Rights Report ,
85the
Commission joined in partnership with research institutions, which provided invalu-able expertise and assisted the Commission to popularize social and economicrights. The Commission arranged training workshops for its staff and other partners,including relevant government departments, to ensure informed assistance. Lettersof inquiry or protocols were then drafted and distributed to the departments relat-ing to each of the rights set forth in the Constitution. The analysis of the informa-tion was assigned to one of the research centres. In addition, a reputable researchagency was commissioned to undertake a survey of popular perceptions of the de-livery of social and economic rights. In the course of the inquiry, the Commissionlearned the importance of investing time in training and providing information to allparticipating government departments so that the information received can be fo-cused and will readily serve the intended purposes; it also learned that this has to bea continuing process.
Because of the importance the Commission attaches to social and economic rights
in South Africa, the Commission teamed up with the South African National NGOCoalition (SANGOCO) to conduct national public hearings on poverty in all nineprovinces of the country. The hearings were important. They underlined the signifi-cance of social and economic rights for a human rights culture. They provided a fo-rum for ordinary people to speak with dignity about their experiences of strugglingagainst poverty, and to share their ideas with others. People’s participation made itpossible to develop a policy framework that was both relevant to the needs of thepeople and informed. 
Monitoring economic, social and cultural rights can be difficult and challenging. State
obligations in relation to these rights include obligations of both conduct and result,and each must be monitored. The requirement of progressive realization of economic,social and cultural rights means that monitoring must continue over time. Rights viola-tions involving large groups will require analysis of complex data.
86And, underlying all
other difficulties, often the relevant standards are not yet fully developed. A nationalhuman rights institution can enhance its ability to conduct accurate and effective mon-

itoring by building internal capacity and by soliciting the active participation of affected
sectors, either directly or through representative civil society organizations.87
Monitoring mechanisms may need to be developed for the local, regional and national levels.
A national human rights institution should also make use of general comments and the
reporting guidelines for States parties prepared by the Committee on Economic, Socialand Cultural Rights. The Committee’s comments are vital to establishing indicators andnational-level benchmarks for monitoring, as they provide interpretative understandingof particular economic, social and cultural rights and corresponding State obligationsunder the Covenant.
A framework for monitoring
Developing an overall framework or plan for monitoring economic, social and cultural
rights will help ensure that sound principles and methodological approaches are imple-mented and that clear and effective analysis results. The framework will support a co-ordinated and focused approach to addressing economic, social and cultural rights.Under the framework, a national human rights institution should develop, for eachmonitoring project, clear terms of reference, a detailed process and a monitoring cycleto ensure regular review over time.
The terms of reference should set out:
■The purpose or rationale for monitoring economic, social and cultural rights;
■The scope of monitoring (for example, violations and/or progressive realization of
economic, social and cultural rights);
■The methodological approaches to be used in data collection, documentation andanalysis, for example, benchmarks, indicators and budget analysis;
■The various sources from which information is to be gathered;
■The assumptions and limitations of the project;
■The time frames for monitoring, analysis and reporting;
■Reporting plans, including format, communications and promotion;
■Activities to be undertaken in following up the report, including in relation to otherfunctions of the national human rights institution;
■Resources (human, technical and financial) required to carry out monitoring;88
■Management requirements, including a multidisciplinary project team (with staff ofvarying skills and qualifications drawn from a number of relevant sections withinthe national institution and outside expert advisers) and its terms of reference.
The process should involve:
1. Identifying appropriate indicators, compatible with the State’s obligations in relation
to economic, social and cultural rights, for monitoring these rights at the nationaland international levels.
2. Establishing appropriate national benchmarks and targets in relation to each indica-
tor and asking: 
■What movement there has been from the benchmark and, if there has not beenpositive movement, why not?
6087Maria Socorro I. Diokno, "Monitoring the progressive realization of housing rights", in Focus Asia-Pacific ,
Newsletter of the Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center (HURIGHTS Osaka), No.16, June 1999.
88Ibid.
■Has the State set targets and, if not, why not?
■Have they been met and, if not, why not?
3. Collecting data during the monitoring period which can be disaggregated accord-
ing to the grounds of prohibited discrimination (such as gender, race, ethnic originor disability) and which are comparable, accurate, impartial and provided over time.
4. Analysing results, drawing conclusions, making recommendations and reporting on
findings for the monitoring period by:
■Considering data from indicators with established benchmarks (national andinternational) to give the current status of economic, social and cultural rightsand help in developing targets to be met;
■Gauging trends by comparing results over time with previous monitoring periods(multi-year analysis) to determine whether and what progress has been made andnational benchmarks achieved;
■Comparing results with international benchmarks also.
Identifying indicators
The indicators selected by a national human rights institution should relate to the legal
obligations of the State under international law, such as under the InternationalConvenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rightsof the Child, and under domestic law. They should relate to the State’s obligation of re-sult and the State’s obligation of conduct.
The obligation of result requires that States ensure in fact the realization of all human
rights. In relation to economic, social and cultural rights, this includes the obligation torealize progressively the rights in full and the obligation to provide immediately the min-imum core levels of rights.
The obligation of conduct relates to the manner in which human rights are realized.
Monitoring acts of commission or omission by the State in meeting its duty to respect,protect, and fulfil economic, social and cultural rights and its specific obligations not todiscriminate and to “take steps” towards progressive realization is a role for national in-stitutions.
89
Indicators to assess economic, social and cultural rights need not be direct and fullmeasures of performance of these obligations. They may be collected for other pur-poses but provide indirect or incomplete but relevant measures of performance. Somesocial development indicators, for example, do not relate directly to human rights butthey can still be meaningful indicators of the enjoyment of economic, social and cul-tural rights.
90
Indicators of a State’s performance of its obligations relating to economic, social andcultural rights can be either quantitative or qualitative measurements.

62ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
10. Quantitative health indicators91
Indicators relating to the right to health may be subdivided into five classes:
1. Information on physical infrastructure, by geographic location, such as the
number and type of hospitals, the number and type of health clinics and the userate for hospitals and clinics;
2. Information on human resources, by age, gender, social class, ethnicity and
geographic location, such as the number and type of doctors, the doctor-patientratio, the number and type of nurses, the number of midwives, the number andtype of other health professionals, the doctor-nurse ratio, shifts and workinghours, standards for professional development, recruitment and promotion andwage levels and benefits provided to health workers;
3. Information on the population, by age, gender, social class, ethnicity and
geographic location, such as the infant mortality rate, the under-five mortalityrate, the incidence of drug abuse and de-addiction, the incidence of alcohol andother substance abuse and de-addiction, the proportion of the youth populationalready immunized and the type of immunization, the mortality rate, themorbidity rate, life expectancy, causes of mortality and morbidity, the prevalenceof HIV/AIDS, the prevalence of mental health problems in the population, theprevalence of teen and youth pregnancy, and population growth;
4. Information on materials and equipment, such as the number and type of
facilities by geographic location, the patient-bed ratio, the affordability of drugs,medicines and laboratory examinations, and the number and type of drugs andmedicines;
5. Information on the extent of access to natural resources, by geographic location,
such as the proportion of households with access to safe and clean potablewater, types of access to safe and clean potable water, the proportion ofhouseholds with access to sanitation facilities and types of access to sanitationfacilities.
Quantitative indicators are relevant statistical or numerical data showing or explaining
prevailing circumstances at a given place at a given point in time.
92Some examples of
quantitative indicators of economic, social and cultural rights are the participation ratesof school-age children in the primary education system and the income levels of ethnicminority groups compared to those of other groups. Many quantitative indicators ofeconomic, social and cultural rights have already been identified and are used by agen-cies such as the World Health Organization and the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme.
Qualitative indicators also attempt to show or explain prevailing circumstances with re-
gard to economic, social and cultural rights, but they are not numerical in nature.Rather, qualitative indicators reflect more intensive but more subjective assessments ofsituations. They are produced, for example, through in-depth interviews of key experts,direct field observation of processes and practices, or a content review of written stud-ies or reports.
91Extrapolated from Maria Socorro I. Diokno, "Monitoring the progressive realization of housing rights". 
92Ibid.
Qualitative indicators entail assumptions that require careful examination and testing
before use.93They cannot simply be taken at face value. Despite their limitations, how-
ever, qualitative indicators are valuable tools that can adequately and accurately meas-ure not only the degree of enjoyment or violation of economic, social and cultural rightsbut also any advances in their realization.
94
Making use of both quantitative and qualitative indicators will provide a better rangeof information for analysing State obligations and State performance and will diminishthe limitations of using either type alone.
Take the right to health as an example. Immunization rates could be one quantitative
indicator or measure of the status of the right to health linked to the State’s obligationof result. A budget analysis of health spending for the past 10 years could also be aquantitative measure, but would be linked to the State’s obligation of conduct, the ob-ligation to “take steps” to realize progressively better health for its citizens. A qualita-tive approach to this issue could take the form of a series of interviews with parents andhealth care providers across urban and rural areas concerning access to immunizationand other health care services. 
Other examples of the use of qualitative indicators include undertaking document con-
tent analysis of existing laws, policies, regulations, national action plans, proposed billsand court and quasi-judiciary rulings for compatibility and compliance with or impacton economic, social and cultural rights and obligations. In addition to analysing thecontent of laws, policies, plans and decisions, their enforcement should also be moni-tored. Monitoring both the State’s ability and its willingness to address economic, so-cial and cultural rights will result in a more comprehensive and defined analysis.
National human rights institutions can be guided in identifying appropriate indicators
by the Covenant itself, the Committee’s general comments and other documents relat-ing to the Covenant. General comments that will be particularly helpful are GeneralComment No. 4 on the right to adequate housing, General Comment No. 12 on theright to adequate food, General Comment No. 13 on the right to education andGeneral Comment No. 14 on the right to the highest attainable standard of health.These documents all relate to the obligation of result.
Other documents, such as General Comment No. 3 on the nature of States parties’ ob-
ligations, General Comment No. 9 on the domestic application of the Covenant and theMaastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, addressthe State’s obligation of conduct.
Articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant, General Comment No.1 and the Committee’s re-
porting guidelines all outline each State’s obligation to submit periodic reports to theCommittee on measures adopted and progress made in achieving economic, social andcultural rights. This provides another basis for a national human rights institution tomonitor the conduct of a State. The Committee’s reporting guidelines require Statesparties to:
■Monitor the status of economic, social and cultural rights in the country;
■Comprehensively review national legislation, administrative rules, procedures andpractices;
■Report on priorities set and policies adopted;
6393McGranahan, Pizarro and Richard, Measurement and Analysis of Socio-Economic Development: An
Enquiry into International Indicators of Development and Quantitative Interrelations of Social andEconomic Components of Development (Geneva, United Nations Institute for Research and Development,
1985).
94Maria Socorro I. Diokno, "Working with indicators to monitor economic, social and cultural rights", paperpresented at the National Human Rights Institutions at Work Asia Regional Training Programme, AntipoloCity, Philippines, May 1999.
■Prepare and publicly consider country reports at the national level before
submitting them to the Committee;
■Make use of international technical assistance.
The Committee’s reporting guidelines also provide a series of questions concerning
each right enumerated in the Covenant to facilitate a State party’s preparation of itscountry reports (see box, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Standards: 6.International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights—reporting guidelines).These same questions can also help a national human rights institution decide what to monitor.
A national human rights institution should also refer to the Committee’s concluding ob-
servations on States’ periodic reports for the Committee’s views on how particularrights are to be interpreted and implemented. The specific concluding observations onthe periodic report of the State in which the national human rights institution is locatedwill be particularly important for that institution’s work in monitoring the State’s per-formance of its obligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights.
A national human rights institution might also turn to other treaties, such as the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women or theConvention on the Rights of the Child, and comments and observations of the commit-tees established under those treaties, as other sources for informing the monitoring ofeconomic, social and cultural rights. 
A national human rights institution can monitor its own relations with the State as one
measure of the State’s willingness to address economic, social and cultural rights. Thiscan be done by looking at the degree to which the Government ensures that the na-tional human rights institution is sufficiently resourced to carry out its mandate effec-tively, and the nature and level of cooperation the institution has received whenundertaking protection and promotion activities.
Lastly, if a national human rights institution is to take a thorough approach to address-
ing economic, social and cultural rights, it will also be important for it to monitor theconduct of non-State actors, including corporations. They have great effects, both pos-itive and negative, on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. The exam-ination of the role of non-State actors should take into account the State’s obligationto protect its citizens through the regulation of non-State actors.
95
Establishing benchmarks and targets
Once indicators to measure economic, social and cultural rights have been determined,
the next step is to establish appropriate national-level benchmarks and targets for eachindicator.
Benchmarks are base-line measurements. They measure performance at the start of the
period in question. Movement from the benchmark indicates whether a State is meet-ing its obligation of progressive realization of the rights concerned. Repeated measure-ments can be examined over a period to track performance.
Targets are goals. They indicate the level of realization of economic, social and cultural
rights considered attainable, and therefore obligatory, within a determined period. Theyshould be realistic, neither merely aspirational and therefore unattainable in fact, norexcessively modest and therefore attainable without effort or commitment. If realistic

Rights: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Activism: A Training Resource; International Human Rights
Internship Program and Asian Forum for Development, 2000, p. 170.
targets are set and then not met, the onus should be on the State to establish that it
has met its obligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights nonetheless.
Each indicator selected should be measured at the start of the period to be monitored
and a target set for that indicator for attainment by the end of the period. Benchmarksand targets should be established at the national level and chosen in relation to Stateobligations under the Covenant and in accordance with the interpretative general com-ments of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. They should be com-pared with and informed by other relevant international standards, such as those set bythe United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organization. Theyshould be reviewed regularly and revised as necessary to take into account progress to-wards the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights.
In its General Comment No.1, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
endorsed this approach to monitoring using benchmarks and targets. The Committeestressed the importance of providing
a basis on which the State party itself, as well as the Committee, can effectively
evaluate the extent to which progress has been made towards the realization ofthe obligations contained in the Covenant. For this purpose, it may be useful forStates to identify specific benchmarks or goals against which their performancein a given area can be assessed. Thus, for example, it is generally agreed that it isimportant to set specific goals with respect to the reduction of infant mortality,the extent of vaccination of children, the intake of calories per person, the num-ber of persons per health-care provider, etc. In many of these areas, global bench-marks are of limited use, whereas national or other more specific benchmarks canprovide an extremely valuable indication of progress.
96
The Committee has gone on to elaborate its own “basis” or benchmarks for evaluat-ing the realization of Covenant obligations in a series of subsequent general comments.General Comment No. 14 on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, forexample, sets a measurable benchmark in stating that the right to prevention, treat-ment and control of diseases (art. 12.2 (c)) requires, as a priority, State “implementa-tion or enhancement of immunization programmes” against the major infectiousdiseases.
A national human rights institution might also use the Committee’s concluding obser-
vations on its Government’s periodic report as another source for establishing bench-marks and targets for future monitoring.
97If, for example, the Committee recommends
that the State take particular steps to increase access to elementary education for girlchildren in rural areas, the national human rights institution can monitor the State’sconduct in this regard over the next reporting period.
A national human rights institution should also make use of the concept of the mini-
mum core content of economic, social and cultural rights as another basis or bench-mark against which to monitor and assess compliance. The Limburg Principles on theImplementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rightscontend that under international law “States Parties are obliged, regardless of the levelof economic development, to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all”.
98
Furthermore, in its General Comment No. 3, the Committee on Economic, Social andCultural Rights holds that the State has an immediate obligation to meet at least the
6596General Comment No. 1 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on reporting by States
parties, para. 6.
97Clarence Dias, "Towards effective monitoring—elements of a monitoring system", paper presented at theNational Human Rights Institutions at Work Asia Regional Training Programme, Antipolo City, Philippines,May 1999.
98Principle 25.
minimum standards associated with the rights contained in the Covenant. The
Committee maintains:
that a minimum core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least,
minimum essential levels of each of the rights is incumbent upon every Stateparty. Thus, for example, a State party in which any significant number of individ-uals is deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health care, of basicshelter and housing, or of the most basic forms of education is, prima facie , fail-
ing to discharge its obligations under the Covenant.
99
Another example of a minimum core requirement is found in General Comment No.14,which establishes a core obligation for States:
to adopt and implement a national public health strategy and plan of action, on
the basis of epidemiological evidence, addressing the health concerns of thewhole population; the strategy and plan of action shall be devised, and periodi-cally reviewed, on the basis of a participatory and transparent process; they shallinclude methods, such as right to health indicators and benchmarks, by whichprogress can be closely monitored; the process by which the strategy and plan ofaction are devised, as well as their content, shall give particular attention to all vul-nerable or marginalized groups.
The appropriateness of defining the minimum core content of a right is greatly debated.
Arguments put forward include the difficulty of setting universally applicable standardsand that doing so will serve to limit the overall guarantee of rights to only those aspectsthat are easily justiciable.
100In any case, a national human rights institution should still
ensure that the content of and national benchmarks for economic, social and culturalrights are being defined and established in accordance with the full range of obliga-tions, including the obligation to apply “the maximum of available resources”. For ex-ample, even a country that easily surpasses minimum requirements of basic levels ofeducation and provides free secondary education to the vast majority of its school-agechildren will still be expected to “take steps” towards the “progressive introduction offree [higher] education”, in accordance with article 13.2 (c) of the Covenant.
It is important, therefore, to find out whether the State has adopted action plans and
specific benchmarks and targets, and if so what they are, and to determine whether theState has improved its performance from the first of the benchmarks and met the tar-gets it has set for itself.
101
Regardless of whether the State has set benchmarks and targets, however, there is arole for a national human rights institution in determining and assessing what are ap-propriate national benchmarks and targets. Other international resources, such as theUNDP Human Development Report
102and the Human Development Index, and specific
national-level human development reports can help in setting appropriate nationalbenchmarks and targets for economic, social and cultural rights. International stan-dards also provide a basis against which national benchmarks and targets can be as-sessed over time.

Collecting data
Data for indicators, benchmarks and targets can come from a variety of sources. Many
government publications contain important quantitative data. Annual governmentbudget reports provide information on the overall mix and proportion of public spend-ing in areas that are more directly related to economic, social and cultural rights, suchas education and health care, and in other areas, such as the military. Programme andannual reports of specific government departments, such as those responsible for edu-cation, health, housing, labour and culture, can provide detailed breakdowns of exactlywhere public funds are being spent in these areas. State planning instruments, such asa national human rights action plan, and country reports to treaty committees also pro-vide important data for monitoring and evaluation.

68ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS STANDARDS
6. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights —
reporting guidelines103
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has prepared reporting
guidelines to help States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Socialand Cultural Rights prepare their submissions and meet their reporting obligationsunder the Covenant. Similar guidelines are provided for each right and can besummarized as follows.
Status
■Provide detailed information on the extent to which the right has been realized.
Identify any groups which do not enjoy the right at all or which do so to asignificantly lesser degree than the majority of the population. In particular, whatis the situation of women in that respect? Give details of such non-enjoyment ofrights.
■Describe the sources of information that exist in this regard, including statisticaldata, surveys and other monitoring arrangements. In particular, provideinformation on indicators pertaining to the right (e.g. health indicator of lifeexpectancy rate as defined by the World Health Organization) and disaggregate bysex, urban/rural division, socio-economic or ethnic group and geographical area. 
Conduct
■Describe all measures taken by the Government, to the maximum of its available
resources, to provide for the right or prevent obstacles to its fulfilment,particularly for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. Include financial measuresand indicate what percentage of gross national product (GNP) as well as of thenational and/or regional budget(s) is spent on the particular right. How does thiscompare with the situation 10 years ago? What reasons are there for anychanges?
■Describe any supportive legal provisions regarding the exercise of the right.Include reference to any legislation prohibiting any and all forms ofdiscrimination. 
■What were the effects of these measures or provisions on fulfilling the right,particularly for vulnerable groups? Report the successes, problems andshortcomings of such measures or provisions.
■What time-related goals and benchmarks has the Government set for measuringachievements in regard to fulfilling the right.
Challenges
■What difficulties/shortcomings have been encountered in the realization of the
right? 
■Describe any legal restrictions placed on the exercise of the right. 
■Describe any changes during the reporting period in court decisions, nationallaws, policies, regulations and practices affecting the right, particularly forvulnerable groups, and evaluate their impact. Include any legislative repeal orreform of existing laws which detracts from the fulfilment of the right.
■What were the effects of these difficulties, provisions or changes on the rights ofvulnerable and disadvantaged groups?
103This is a summary of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights "Revised general guidelines
regarding the form and contents of reports to be submitted by States parties under articles 16 and 17 ofthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights" (E/C.12/1991/1).
69■What time-related goals and benchmarks has the Government set and what
measures have been taken to remedy these situations?
Participation
■How are vulnerable groups informed of their respective rights?
■What measures have been taken to maximize community participation in the
planning, organization, operation and control of a right?
■Describe the role, if any, of international assistance in the full realization of theright.
National census data, where available, can be a particularly good source of quantitative
indicators, such as labour force participation rates or levels of education, for measuringand assessing the status of economic, social and cultural rights. The census may havebeen designed and conducted in a way that allows for disaggregation of data, for example, by marginalized group status, such as women or ethnic minorities, or by geographic regions and urban and rural areas.
All this presupposes a conducive political climate in which the State collects data, pre-
pares reports and makes them available publicly in the first place. If this is not the case,it will be necessary for a national human rights institution to call for the State to be pub-licly accountable and engage in human rights monitoring and reporting activity. In anycase, monitoring efforts should rely on diverse sources of information.
Apart from the State, civil society organizations, including non-governmental organiza-
tions, and academic institutions can be valuable sources of both quantitative and qual-itative data on economic, social and cultural rights. International data resources, suchas the UNDP Human Development Report, and the Statistical Yearbook or WorldEducation Report of UNESCO, can also provide objective and comparable data overtime.
A national human rights institution should not forget to look to itself as a potential
source of data for measuring the status of economic, social and cultural rights. It cancollect and track data on inquiries and complaints it has received, and cases it has in-vestigated. These data on inquiries and complaints could be broken down by:
■Number of cases and their median age;
■Ratio of new cases to cases closed;
■Nature of the alleged rights violations;
■Complainants’ marginalized group status;
■Respondents’ public or private sector sphere of responsibility;
■Disposition and expediency.
Where there is lack of reported information or focus on particular economic, social and
cultural rights issues, the national human rights institution might choose to conduct orcommission a survey and the collection of new data. 
Analysing the information
The key requirement for a national human rights institution and other organizations
monitoring human rights is good analysis of the information and then use of the infor-mation for better protection and promotion of rights. The analysis must relate both thequantitative and qualitative data for the identified indicators to the established bench-
marks and targets in order to determine whether the State is meeting its obligations
with respect to economic, social and cultural rights.
The analysis should address the terms of reference for the monitoring project. It should
identify those aspects of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights or domestic law that are at issue, and ultimately address the following questions:
■Has the State met its obligations to respect, protect and fulfil economic, socialand cultural rights?
■Has the State met the minimum core requirements of each right?
■Has there been “progressive realization” of economic, social and cultural rightsover time?
■Has the State met its immediate obligations to “take steps”, as well as not todiscriminate? If not, in what ways? Which groups have been affected?
■Has the State condoned non-State violators of economic, social and culturalrights or has it taken action to protect the public?
■Can the State justify a claim of competing rights, policy priorities and/or limitedresources as a defence for any failure to meet its obligations?
The analysis should detail how the State has met or has not meet its obligations and
what groups have been affected.
Because the obligation to realize economic, social and cultural rights is “to the maxi-
mum of its available resources”, analysis of the State budget and the State’s revenueand expenditure patterns is a means of assessing whether the State is meeting its obli-gations. This can involve examining expenditure, revenue and macro-economic policies.A national human rights institution can play an important role in budget analysis as partof its function of monitoring economic, social and cultural rights.
104It will require ex-
pert assistance in doing so, either from qualified staff or external consultants. In ap-proaching this task, the national institution can learn from experiences in a number ofcountries where official and non-governmental organizations undertake this kind ofwork. It can draw also on other innovative approaches to budget development andanalysis. Groups in South Africa have suggested developing a “socio-economic rightsbudget” to indicate the extent to which these rights are being advanced through thebudget. Others have suggested including a gender dimension in budgetary analysis. Inthe Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, 25 per cent of the city budget is allocated by neigh-bourhood-level political groupings on the basis of local needs expressed by citizens.
105
70104Concerning the role of civil society in budget analysis, see Budget Analysis and Policy Priority: DISHA's
Experience (Ahmedabad, DISHA, 1995).
105The Covenant also includes an obligation to implement the Covenant "individually and through
international assistance and cooperation especially economic and technical". On this point, the LimburgPrinciples state: "29. International cooperation and assistance pursuant to the Charter of the UnitedNations (arts. 55 and 56) and the Covenant shall have in view as a matter of priority the realization of allhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, economic, social and cultural as well as civil and political; 30.International cooperation and assistance must be directed towards the establishment of a social andinternational order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Covenant can be fully realized (cf.article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights); 31.Irrespective of differences in their political,economic and social systems, States shall cooperate with one another to promote international social,economic and cultural progress, in particular the economic growth of developing countries, free fromdiscrimination based on such differences; 32. States parties shall take steps by international means toassist and cooperate in the realization of the rights recognized by the Covenant; 33. Internationalcooperation and assistance shall be based on the sovereign equality of States and be aimed at therealization of the rights contained in the Covenant; 34. In undertaking international cooperation andassistance pursuant to article 2.1 the role of international organizations and the contribution of non-governmental organizations shall be kept in mind."
The quality of the analysis of data in any monitoring programme will depend on infor-
mation drawn from many sources and information of many different types. Examiningquantitative and qualitative indicators together will be particularly important.
Once again, take the right to health as an example. Quantitative data showing an in-
crease in mortality rates from infectious diseases for 80 per cent of a country’s popula-tion over a 10-year period might indicate the State’s failure to meet its obligation ofresult and to realize progressively the right to health under the International Covenanton Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Diminishing immunization rates for the sameperiod might be a further quantitative indicator, this time of the State failing to meetits obligation of conduct to take steps to fulfil the right. And quantitative data showingthat immunization rates only meet national and international standards for that part ofthe State’s population living in urban areas would be a strong indicator of discrimina-tion against rural poor populations and of an immediate violation of the Covenant.
State expenditure patterns, both over time and among the various governmental func-
tions, would be another source of important quantitative data. Budgetary allocationsshed light on a State’s values, priorities, actions and intent. In the case of the right tohealth, they could explain the causes of changes in mortality and immunization rates.If expenditure patterns show that sufficient funds were actually made available for im-munization services in both urban and rural areas, and that total health funding hasbeen steadily increasing, quantitative data alone will not allow any firm conclusions tobe drawn.
A qualitative study of parents and health services in different geographic areas, includ-
ing typical urban and rural areas, would supplement the quantitative data. Respondentsmight say that lack of local health clinics, affordable public transport and public educa-tion on the importance of immunization are the main factors impeding access to thisservice. The results of the qualitative analysis could point to other useful quantitativeand qualitative indicators for verification and follow-up, such as a national public healthstrategy or other policy on access to health clinics, health education and public trans-port. Analysing all this data together enables some well-founded conclusions to bedrawn about the status of the right to health and the adequacy of the State’s perform-ance of its obligations relating to this right.
Monitoring efforts should also seek information that supplements external indicators
and provides a better understanding of economic, social and cultural rights. Complaintsprovide a very useful source of information about deficiencies in the protection of hu-man rights. The national human rights institution should analyse data resulting from itsown inquiries and the complaints that it and government departments, the judiciaryand even civil society organizations receive. An analysis of individual complaints mightreveal a systemic pattern of discrimination in access to health services for marginalizedgroups. It could also indicate the effectiveness of those organizations with a mandateor responsibility to protect and promote economic, social and cultural rights.Specifically, the analysis of complaints can provide information on:
■Types of economic, social and cultural rights violations alleged, for example pastviolations, violations in progress or anticipated violations;
■Which marginalized groups are being affected or at least which groups aremaking allegations and have access to the national human rights institution orother complaints mechanism;
■The willingness, capability, timeliness and success rate of a particular organizationin dealing with economic, social and cultural rights.
71
Developing conclusions and recommendations
If monitoring is to be as useful as possible, the national human rights institution should
move beyond analysis to develop its own conclusions and recommendations. It shouldexpress its views on what needs to be done to close any gap between the current sta-tus of economic, social and cultural rights and identified national targets.Recommendations might deal with both individual and broader public interest reme-dies, in order to address immediate violations and the progressive realization of rights. 
Individual remedies are considered appropriate if they restore victims, as far as possible,
to the position they would have been in had their rights not been violated, and ensurethat their rights are no longer violated. They might include the award of specific dam-ages, such as compensation for lost property or livelihood, or general damages, such ascompensation for pain and suffering. Public interest remedies are considered appropri-ate if they set out to prevent future violation of rights. They might include changes inlaws, policies and programmes, and public education initiatives. The MaastrichtGuidelines and the revised draft Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to aRemedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rightsand Humanitarian Law,
106provide guidance to national human rights institutions in de-
veloping recommendations on remedies.
Reporting
The principal purpose of monitoring is to improve future performance in protecting and
promoting human rights. This purpose is best achieved when the results of monitoringare the subject of a thorough, appropriate public report. Reports should be accurateand reflect the objectivity of the investigation and analysis undertaken. They shouldavoid jargon, rhetoric or exaggeration.
107They should be informative as to past per-
formance and directive as to future strategies.
Reports should include the terms of reference for the project in question, discussion of
the nature and content of the rights addressed, a description of indicators, the data col-lection methodologies and sources of information used, a summary of the benchmarkdata, arguments to justify the targets adopted, a fair and balanced analysis of the data,and recommendations. 
Sources of information used for the reports should be evaluated for validity and relia-
bility. Any information or evidence that was disregarded should be acknowledged ingeneral terms. Government positions and responses on matters raised in the reports,and efforts to obtain such comment, should also be documented. Allegations madeshould be separated from the national human rights institution’s conclusions, andanalysis of the facts from any recommendations the national institution may wish to make.
How reports are to be formulated, used and disseminated should be considered at the
outset when monitoring activities are being planned and terms of reference set. A na-tional human rights institution might choose to structure its reports to match the frame-works established by other reporting mechanisms, such as the reporting guidelines ofthe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights for the periodic reports submit-ted by States under the Covenant.
Monitoring reports can and should be used to support the other functions of the na-
tional human rights institution, such as investigation and litigation of cases, and public

promotional activities involving economic, social and cultural rights. They should also
be useful to non-governmental organizations in their work.
Developing a communications strategy for the promotion of the report should be an
early part of the planning process for a monitoring project. A proper communicationsstrategy can increase the impact of a monitoring report by bringing it to public and po-litical attention through the media, conferences, seminars, public addresses and otheractivities, including release to coincide with relevant anniversaries. The communicationsstrategy should also include reporting in alternative formats. The full report may be in-accessible for many people who would be interested in it. The production of abridged,simplified audio and video versions of the report can increase awareness of its findingsand recommendations, and build support for its implementation.

C. P ROMOTING ECONOMIC ,SOCIAL AND
CULTURAL RIGHTS
Why promote economic, social and cultural rights?
Human rights promotion encompasses creating awareness and imparting knowledge
about human rights so that they may be better enjoyed.108The protection of rights de-
pends on people knowing about the rights they have and about mechanisms to enforcethem.
109It also depends on people knowing and accepting their obligations to uphold
those rights. Human rights promotion supports the prevention of violations, discour-ages impunity, encourages a culture of human rights and ultimately empowers individ-uals and groups.
110
Virtually without exception, the mandates of national human rights institutions givethem the important responsibility of promoting human rights. Because all human rightsare interdependent and indivisible, human rights promotion must include the promo-tion of economic, social and cultural rights. The promotion of economic, social and cul-tural rights should, however, complement, not replace, the investigation andmonitoring of these rights.
Promotion of human rights is encompassed in the national human rights institution
goals and functions of:
■Informing and educating about human rights;
■Fostering the development of values and attitudes which uphold human rights;
■Encouraging action aimed at defending human rights from violation.111
Activities and actions for economic, social and cultural rights promotion should be di-verse and could include:
■Advancing and promoting national human rights institution policy positions;
■Providing advice (solicited or otherwise) to and assisting the State or otherorganizations;
■Responding to external requests for comment on initiatives, consultations,documents and reports;
■Participating in meetings, conferences, workshops and consultations;
■Preparing print and electronic publications;
■Disseminating information;
■Releasing reports and issuing media releases on a range of national human rightsinstitution activities, including the results of investigations or monitoring;
■Conducting public campaigns, such as radio or television promotions;

Institutions …, para. 140.
75■Developing and/or delivering professional training and education programmes or
seminars.
Education and other promotional activities can help address the low level of awareness
and understanding of economic, social and cultural rights and foster people’s involve-ment, allowing them to understand their own situations within a larger human rightscontext. Promotion can encourage individuals and groups to set goals and to plan andimplement action, including further promotion and advocacy, to advance economic, so-cial, cultural and other rights. Placing economic and social conditions within a rightsframework will also encourage a broader human rights approach to development gen-erally.
Promotional activities also give a national human rights institution the opportunity to
publicize its own mandates, including not only human rights promotion but also inves-tigation and monitoring functions. The national human rights institution’s unique roleas a catalyst in reaching State actors and bringing the State and civil society togetherfalls within its promotional mandate as well. Engaging in effective human rights pro-motion activities should also assist the national institution to increase its accountabilityand credibility in the eyes of the public.
Principles
The promotion of economic, social and cultural rights should be an element in all the
functions and activities of a national human rights institution and should address thefull range of human rights. 
A gender perspective should be an integral part of the design and implementation of
promotional activities. It will recognize and address the different impact economic, so-cial and cultural rights have for women and for men, and their difference experienceswith regard to these rights.
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
11. Promoting the independence and indivisibility of rights
The interdependence and indivisibility of all human rights are important concepts
that should be promoted to a variety of audiences. At the national level, for exam-ple, promotional activities might focus on helping the State meet its obligations touphold both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rightsthrough better access and coordination among public organizations, programmesand services. At the local level, promotional activities might focus on helping com-munity members understand and address rights and obligations, for example, con-cerning the impact of environmental practices on agriculture and access to food andlivelihood.
A rural perspective is also important. Minority groups often live in remote rural areas
where their living conditions are far below those of urban dwellers. Rights are more eas-ily violated in remote areas away from the gaze of human rights monitors and the me-dia. People in these areas need to know their rights in order to be able to exercise them.
Promotional activities are more effective and more significant where they focus on the
concrete implications and experience of human rights in practice rather than merely onabstract concepts or legal texts. Promotional activities may often focus only on the dis-semination of information on human rights standards as an end in itself. But this means
76that the underlying structural factors that are at the root of human rights problems are
avoided and the educational and promotional activities themselves are not assessed fortheir effectiveness.
The process of developing, delivering and participating in economic, social and cultural
rights promotion should itself reflect human rights by being participatory in nature, pro-moting dialogue and showing respect for the dignity of those involved. Promotional ac-tivities are of greatest benefit when they are participatory, progressive, creative andflexible in reaching and meeting the needs of varying audiences.
112Their content and
implementation should be timely and relevant, to ensure interest and maximize effectfor the target audience. They should influence and convince audiences and mobilizethem towards concrete action and change, both in the short and the long term. Theyshould move audiences to transfer acquired knowledge and skills to others and to un-dertake integrated and sustainable action on economic, social and cultural rights. Andwhenever possible, they should be programme-based and part of a broader plan.
When designing promotional activities, a national human rights institution can benefit
from existing resources, experiences and initiatives such as the United Nation’s Decadefor Human Rights Education. Through professional networking with other national hu-man rights institutions, civil society and international organizations, a national institu-tion can share information about and access to available resources, potential partnersand success stories. And because many non-governmental organizations and commu-nity-based organizations have had years of experience developing and delivering hu-man rights education, they can help a national human rights institution reach affectedcommunities.
The unique role of national human rights institutions in establishing and strengthening
cooperative relationships with Governments, non-governmental organizations and civilsociety makes them well placed to manage the process of developing, delivering andevaluating promotional activities. Managing the process can be made easier throughthe use of a multidisciplinary project or programme team. A multidisciplinary teamshould consist of staff and members from across departments and mandates of the na-tional institution, as well as external partners, resource persons and target group repre-sentatives, who have expertise in the subject content, curriculum design, publicationsdevelopment, communications, facilitation or logistics. National human rights institu-tions should look to civil society, and non-governmental organizations in particular, aspartners in developing promotional activities.
The project or programme team will need to assess at the outset the human, technical
and financial resources required for the activities. Development and delivery responsi-bilities and time frames will need to be assigned to team members. Logistical arrange-ments before, during and after events, such as arrangements for meeting rooms andtechnical equipment, also require careful planning. A national human rights institutionwill be more successful in promoting economic, social and cultural rights if initiativesare carefully designed and derive from a strategic plan or framework. 
A framework for promotion
As with monitoring, promoting economic, social and cultural rights is most effective
when undertaken according to a well-developed framework or plan. The frameworkshould identify the purpose or rationale for economic, social and cultural rights promo-tion, based on the mandate of the national human rights institution. It should also setout the methodologies, resources, responsibilities, time frames and processes for devel-oping, delivering and evaluating promotional activities.
112See "Education for empowerment: some reflections" (Module 20), Circle of Rights: Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights Activism: A Training Resource .
Within this framework, the national human rights institution should:
1. Identify participants, issues and needs.
2. Set goals and objectives.3. Determine content and formulate programmes.4. Prepare materials.5. Conduct the promotional activities.6. Evaluate and follow-up.
These steps are not strictly chronological and do not stand alone. Rather, developing
and working through one part of the process will affect other parts and result inchanges to previous thinking. For example, attempts at translating an objective intoconcrete promotional activities may result in revisions or a complete change to the ini-tial objective. Or it may be discovered only while conducting and evaluating an activitythat its formulation was flawed and ineffective. 
Flexibility in developing activities and in implementing them will assist a national human
rights institution to benefit from the contributions of others and meet the needs of allinvolved. Lessons learned through the development, implementation and evaluation ofpromotional initiatives can be applied to later stages of the process, encouraging dy-namic and progressive thinking for current and future initiatives.
Identifying participants, issues and needs
Participants, audiences or groups that might be targeted for economic, social and cul-
tural rights promotion, and the nature and degree of their interest and participation,can vary widely. The promotional strategies required if, for example, the goal is to reacha middle-class population would be quite different from those required to reach poorpeople or to train government officials. 
Target audiences are quite diverse and could include:
■Vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as indigenous communities, women
and children;
■Local, regional and national levels of the State, including the executive, ministries,sectoral agencies, the legislature and the judiciary;
■Professional groups, such as lawyers and medical practitioners;
■Formal and informal educational systems, and other public institutions andservices, such as hospitals;
■Private-sector business, including national and multinational corporations:
■Non-governmental organizations (local, national and international), including:
■●Social development agencies;
■●Human rights organizations;
■●Social action groups;
■●Sectoral organizations;
■●Law groups;
■●Arts and cultural groups;
■Other civil society organizations and groups;
■The general public.
77
There are other individuals and groups who may not be identified as a target audience
but whose roles and needs might also be considered when promotional activities relat-ing to economic, social and cultural rights are being planned. The national human rightsinstitution might look first at the role and needs of its own members and staff and ofpersonnel from potential partners in the programme. The national institution shouldalso look to others with particular expertise, including specialist trainers, facilitators, re-source persons, expert consultants and other external partners, who can provide usefulassistance in the development, delivery and sponsorship of promotional activities.
Different target audiences will require different approaches. The existing knowledge,
attitudes, skills and needs of the target audience for each promotional activity must beidentified and addressed in the programme development. Possible differences in under-standing and awareness among the public, government officials and even the judiciaryabout the specific nature of economic, social and cultural rights and the State’s obliga-tion to respect, protect and fulfil these rights must also be taken into account. 
In developing promotional activities a national human rights institution should not as-
sume that it knows what is needed and by whom. It must be open to independent as-sessment of needs. A review of recent national and local incidents and events, alongwith quantifiable indicators of the current status of enjoyment and violation of humanrights, will help to identify and verify key target groups, issues and needs relevant toeconomic, social and cultural rights promotion. The national institution can also use in-formation resulting from monitoring or investigations. It could meet with representa-tives of target groups to discuss needs more directly. Ensuring that a gender perspectiveis taken into account, for example, will be critical if promotional activities are to be suc-cessful in addressing the issues and needs of women. In addition, pre-training assign-ments or questionnaires sent to targeted participants and surveys of general audiencescan provide valuable material for setting goals and objectives and for focusing contentand learning methodologies.
After having identified emerging problems and issues, and the characteristics and
needs of those whom promotional activities might concern, the national human rightsinstitution can begin to set goals and objectives for economic, social and cultural rightspromotion.
Setting goals and objectives
In developing promotional activities, whether as a comprehensive strategy or a single
activity, a national human rights institution should first establish clear goals and objec-tives.
Setting goals and formulating objectives help to clarify what is to be accomplished by
an initiative. Generally speaking, goals are typically broad and cover the whole event,whereas objectives are more specific and are expressed in observable and measurableterms. Goals and objectives should be clearly stated and communicated so that peopleknow what the national human rights institution or other trainers and facilitators intendto do and what the expected outcomes are. They should be realistic for the time avail-able, be appropriate and supported by the target group, flow logically from one to thenext, promote action as a response to the programme and address what the nationalhuman rights institution wants people to know, do and feel.
113
A national human rights institution could develop and adopt a comprehensive strategyfor the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights. Under a broad strategy, thegoals and objectives could include capacity building, disseminating information to the
78113See Training for Human Rights Trainers , Canadian Human Rights Foundation training programme
handbook., Kiev, November 1996.
79general public or advising or assisting the State. The strategy might cover a variety of
target audiences and different means for reaching them and include a number of pro-gramme components, each with its own goals and objectives. The goals and objectivescould be broken down by short- or long-term needs or whether a particular national,regional or local geographic focus is required.
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
12. Setting goals and formulating objectives
A possible goal for an economic, social and cultural rights initiative is to strengthen
the capacity of State agencies to promote and protect the economic, social and cul-tural rights of its citizens through a legislative framework. Three specific objectivesto accomplish this goal could involve:
■Examining the role of different groups involved in economic, social and culturalrights protection and promotion;
■Exploring the State's obligations to respect, protect, promote and fulfileconomic, social and cultural rights;
■Developing practical strategies for State agencies to employ in the promotionand protection of economic, social and cultural rights.
Is the goal to change values and attitudes among the target audience or simply to pre-
vent behaviour that violates human rights, or both? These are quite different goals. Agovernment agency might be persuaded to adopt new, rights-sensitive policies, for ex-ample, but that is of little benefit unless the new policies are implemented. A transna-tional corporation might not be swayed by a promotional campaign that focuses onhuman rights values and attitudes, but it might change its behaviour if it fears prosecu-tion or a loss of profit. One target audience may need to have a better understandingof its rights and how to exercise them and another a better understanding of the obli-gations it has to uphold those rights.
A national human rights institution might choose to focus plans and initiatives on par-
ticular economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to housing, or on a partic-ular obligation, such as “progressive realization”. Alternatively, promotional initiativescould focus on identified problems with or obstacles to the advancement of rights, suchas lack of policy priority, enabling legislation, administrative regulations, enforcementmechanisms or available resources.
Programmes should also include, as part of their objectives and design, opportunities
during and following activities for networking and collaboration among target groupsand other partners, with national human rights institutions as catalysts.
As goals and objectives are elaborated, overall themes for initiatives or plans should be-
gin to emerge. Five such economic, social and cultural rights themes, which will be ad-dressed later in this section of the handbook, are:
■Promoting government recognition of economic, social and cultural rights andobligations;
■Promoting judicial recognition of the justiciability of economic, social andcultural rights;
■Promoting awareness, understanding and empowerment of economic, socialand cultural rights through public education;
■Promoting observance of economic, social and cultural rights by non-State
actors;
■Training small groups in economic, social and cultural rights.
Determining content and formulating programmes
The nature and content of a promotional programme should be based on the identified
target audience and its needs, learning goals and objectives, and on the time and re-sources available. They should take account of lessons learned from past experience.The content to be covered in the activities or actions should be specified in some detail,along with related issues, themes, key messages and other information.
A national human rights institution will need to decide what type of activity will be most
effective for delivering the content. Activities and actions for promoting economic, so-cial and cultural rights can vary widely, depending on the target audience. When seek-ing to influence the Government and the legislature, the institution might advancepolicy positions, provide assistance or unsolicited advice, respond to written requestsfor comment and participate in meetings or workshops. When seeking to influence andtrain individuals, whether from government bodies, non-governmental organizationsor community groups, it might run training and education programmes or use existingactivities, such as staff development and continuing education or training programmes,annual conferences or regularly scheduled meetings. When seeking to reach, influenceand inform a broader public, it might conduct public education campaigns, media cam-paigns and media events, and disseminate information.
114
A national human rights institution could pursue one particular approach to economic,social and cultural rights promotion, such as training workshops for public officials, ormedia advertising. This certainly establishes a well recognized area of activity for the na-tional institution, permits a clearly focused programme and encourages the develop-ment of expertise within the institution. It is far better, however, for a national humanrights institution to adopt a broader and longer-term strategic plan with many pro-gramme and activity components. This approach takes account of the diversity of inter-ests and needs within a State, the number of different groups that influence theenjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and the broad responsibilities a na-tional human rights institution has as an official human rights organization. It enablesthe national institution to address many different target groups over time. It also enables it to use its resources to best effect through a combination of methodologiesand activities.
However, whether large or small, effective promotional initiatives require sound educa-
tional methodologies, must be concrete and centred on the identified participants ortarget audiences as much as possible, and incorporate evaluation and follow-up as partof their design.
Media campaigns offer the best possibility of reaching large numbers of people. For
that reason alone, they are very attractive to a national human rights institution wish-ing to communicate a human rights message broadly, quickly and efficiently. However,they also raise particular difficulties. They require specific expertise that a national hu-man rights institution might not have among its own staff. They will be very expensiveto conduct unless media organizations donate time and space for the campaign. Theycan only communicate simple messages and do so in a very broad, unfocused way. Theyare not good at changing attitudes and developing values. They are difficult to evalu-

Human Rights Institutions at Work: Regional Workshop on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 5-10November 2000, Manila, Philippines. 
ate and to follow up. Because the media can influence people subconsciously and indi-
rectly, a media campaign must be very carefully designed so as not to communicate adifferent message from the one intended. A national institution cannot avoid using themedia for mass communication of information and views; the media provide opportu-nities for communication far beyond any other mechanism at its disposal. But the me-dia must be used strategically and skilfully.
Many national human rights institutions conduct human rights training courses or
workshops for groups of participants. Although such training courses of workshopsreach relatively small numbers of people, they can be useful elements in a broader pro-motional strategy. They can provide an intensive learning experience for key peoplefrom particular organizations or from particular community or population groups.Because the numbers able to participate are small, national human rights institutionsshould be careful to ensure that those they train are key individuals able either to effectsignificant change in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights or to trainothers in economic, social and cultural rights and responsibilities. The training of smallgroups is discussed later in this section of the handbook, which itself may be a sourcefor such training.
Preparing promotional materials
Promotional activities require good promotional materials. Of course, the nature of the
materials will vary according to the nature of the programme.
Materials for a broad and diverse audience must be appropriately designed to take ac-
count of differences in language, culture and ethnic background. Public education ma-terial should be available in a variety of formats, including print, electronic text file,website, e-mail and possibly audio or captioned video. This will ensure that those whoreceive it can understand the message it contains. It will also provide access for a wideraudience, including persons with disabilities, who may require alternative formats forreceiving information. Plain-language versions of some materials may also be requiredin order to reach those with low literacy skills. Care should be taken to ensure consis-tency of terminology and message content among different materials that have similarpromotional objectives.
Materials for small group workshops can be more narrowly focused because the char-
acteristics and needs of the recipients will be known. Handbooks for participants andsupplementary handbooks for trainers can be invaluable tools, especially when theworkshops are comprehensive in scope and relatively lengthy. The handbooks can alsohelp with the transfer of learning after the programme and can be adapted for futuretraining. Handbooks should include clearly stated objectives, methodologies and ex-pected outcomes and indicate how the content was selected and who was involved.Handbooks might be organized by module themes and provide a detailed schedule ofactivities and events, including speakers, the purpose and nature of the workshop ac-tivities, reference information and worksheets. Other learning materials might includechecklists, charts, case summaries, overhead presentations, videos and CD ROM orInternet resources. Handbooks and other materials should always be user-friendly intheir layout and format.
When economic, social and cultural rights promotion takes the form of providing ad-
vice and assistance to the State or other organizations, national human rights institu-tions will find it helpful to prepare support materials, which could range from anadvisory letter, briefing notes, a summary of meeting discussions or a speech to morelengthy policy and/or background papers.
81
Conducting promotional activities
Many factors should be considered when carrying out promotional activities or events.
They will vary according to the nature of the activity or event, whether broad public ed-ucation programmes, advice or assistance to the State or other organizations, partici-pation in meetings or consultations, training and education workshops, or courses oneconomic, social and cultural rights.
In each case, good organization is critical to the effectiveness of the activities or events.
They must be well planned, because logistical problems can affect the ability to achieveobjectives. In general, the larger the programme, the more complex the organizationaltask will be. Arranging a public education programme can involve not only preparingmaterial but ensuring adequate resources for the campaign, booking media time andspace, developing and conducting parallel activities and events, briefing relevant gov-ernment agencies and human rights non-governmental organizations on the campaignand assisting them to prepare for any increased demand as a result of it, arranging forstaff or other personnel to receive and respond to enquiries generated by the cam-paign, preparing for an increase in complaints as a result of increased awareness andknowledge produced by the campaign, and so on.
Even small workshops can generate significant organizational requirements. The logis-
tical tasks include setting of dates, choosing appropriate facilities, clear communicationwith invitees, facilitators or resource persons, travel and accommodation arrangements,on-site registration, distribution of materials, posting signs and instructions, setting uprooms and equipment, recording events and checking everything again and again.
The actual conduct of the programme or activity will raise other issues, depending on
the nature of the programme or activity. Again, a national human rights institution candraw on the knowledge and experience of many organizations that have developedand conducted these kinds of programmes.
115
Evaluating and following up
All promotional activities should be evaluated to determine if their goals and objectives
have been achieved. Evaluation is important not only to determine the effectiveness ofthe activity but also to help a national human rights institution develop its future activ-ities and programmes. The plan for the activity should include a clear idea of what willconstitute successful promotion and how success will be measured. It should establishkey evaluation measures that can be applied after the activity has been completed.
Evaluation should incorporate the views of the target audience. If the activity is a broad
public education campaign, these views might be collected through survey of a sampleof the larger target population. If it is a small workshop or group activity, then all par-ticipants could be encouraged to contribute their personal views to the evaluation,through informal discussion or the completion of an evaluation questionnaire, or both.The views of those involved in conducting the programme or activity should also besought. Questions might include:
■Was the purpose or objective of the activity clear?
■Was the information provided also clear?
■Did the activity meet the objective?
■Did the activity respond to the needs of the target audience?
■Was the approach used (that is, the technique, activity type and design)appropriate to the content, the context and the target group?
82115For group training programmes, for example, see Julius E. Eitington, The Winning Trainer: Winning Ways
to Involve People in Learning , 3rd edition, (Houston Texas, Gulf Publishing Company, 1996); and Training
for Human Rights Trainers (note 113).
The evaluation should also consider the effectiveness of the process used to develop the
initiative, the logistics of its implementation and the capabilities of those involved in thepreparation and presentation of material.
Promoting State recognition of obligations relating to economic, social and
cultural rights 
National human rights institutions must make concerted efforts to promote govern-
ment recognition of economic, social and cultural rights obligations. Many governmentofficials, including ministers and other political leaders, often lack understanding ofeconomic, social and cultural rights issues or are unwilling to address them appropri-ately. Because of its unique status and mandate, a national human rights institution iswell placed to engage the State on human rights matters.
Most national human rights institutions are empowered to advise the State on human
rights issues and to assist various branches of Government in promoting and protect-ing human rights through legislation, regulations, policies, programmes and adminis-trative practices. A national human rights institution may be entrusted withresponsibility for drawing the Government’s attention to human rights violations andmaking concrete proposals for initiatives to end violations. It may be able to submitopinions on proposed or existing legislation directly to the legislature, to initiate or as-sist in drafting new legislation and to intervene in legal proceedings involving humanrights questions. Many national human rights institutions are playing an increasingly im-portant role in overseeing the national implementation of international human rightsstandards and in assisting Governments to fulfil their reporting obligations under inter-national treaties.
116A national human rights institution can also help to ensure that
policies and programmes of the State are developed from a perspective, or through a“lens”, that addresses the rights of women and other marginalized groups.
Another promotional strategy might be for a national human rights institution to ac-
centuate and reinforce the economic, social and cultural rights components of existinggovernment programmes or agencies, such as those dealing with rural and urban de-velopment or the environment and natural resources, or those that focus on disadvan-taged groups, such as women, children and indigenous people.
National budget review and analysis are also very important and effective ways of mon-
itoring and promoting adherence to economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, as-sisting and advising the State on the development of national action plans can helpensure a coherent and coordinated institutional framework for addressing economic,social and cultural rights. Action plans can serve to clarify the precise nature of Stateobligations and to develop standards and benchmarks for measuring compliance. Theycan be effective tools for holding Governments accountable for their performance withrespect to their obligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights.
117
Another starting point for a national human rights institution could be to promote theratification and domestic implementation of international human rights instruments,such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that theState has not already ratified. Most States have ratified most human rights treaties, butimplementation is generally lacking. The failure to integrate international standards intodomestic legislation would provide a pertinent focus for promotional activities. TheCovenant itself requires that “all appropriate means, including particularly the adoptionof legislative measures,” should be taken to satisfy the State’s obligations to “takesteps” to achieve the realization of economic, social and cultural rights (art. 2.1). 
83116Paragraph 76 of the Lindburg Principles and paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 1 emphasize that
reporting should facilitate public scrutiny of the State and encourage involvement of non-governmentaland civil society organizations in the formulation, implementation and review of relevant policies.

84ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
13. The National Human Rights Commission of India promotes health
rights118
Recognizing that the persistence of maternal anaemia, infant mortality, maternal
mortality and morbidity is the antithesis of any notion of human development, theNational Human Rights Commission of India, in cooperation with UNICEF and theDepartment of Women and Child Development, decided to address itself to theseissues in a two-day national workshop on human rights and health, with specialreference to maternal anaemia.
The workshop, held in April 2000, brought together eminent scientists, policy
makers, civil servants, legal experts and social activists, as well as the Minister ofState for Information and Broadcasting, the Minister of State for Health and FamilyWelfare and the Minister of State for Women and Child Development.
Delivering the keynote address at the inaugural function, the Chairperson of the
National Human Rights Commission said that positive recommendations werenecessary for formulating a proper health policy and implementing it as early aspossible to improve the status of health in the nation. Explaining why theCommission was involved in the prevention of maternal anaemia, the Chairpersonsaid that health was a very significant human right. The right to life, guaranteed inarticle 21 of the Indian Constitution, was to be read as a right to life with dignity.That made every aspect of human dignity equally sacrosanct and each one of thema human right.
Quoting Amartya Sen on the “three unfreedoms” that afflict Indian society, the
Chairperson said that improved care was imperative to the achievement of a bettersociety. Lamenting the existing deficiencies in that area, he said that every section ofsociety should come together to provide an answer to the problem. TheCommission’s role in that sphere was to bring together all policy makers, decisiontakers and implementers. The right to good health was embodied in theConstitution and it was a duty of every citizen to ensure it. The Chairperson calledupon the media to create more awareness about the problem. Safe motherhoodand healthy children, he stressed, would ensure a better future for the country.
A national human rights institution may better assist and advise the State if the policy-
making process of the State is open, transparent and participatory. In this regard, thenational institution might consider taking advantage of existing mechanisms, such asparliamentary standing committees, public hearings or other consultative forums, asanother means of assisting and advising the State when economic, social and culturalrights matters are at issue. In addition, the national human rights institution could sub-mit comment to assist the State in meeting its reporting obligations under theCovenant. Such comment should be a scrutiny of State policy and action and might alsobe submitted directly to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Thenational human rights institution can encourage an open and participatory policy-making and reporting process where none exists.
To use its advisory capacity and undertake other promotional activities effectively, na-
tional human rights institutions may need to build internal capacity and acquire or de-velop certain skills, including legislative analysis, negotiation, report writing and oralpresentation.
118Text adapted from National Human Rights Commission of India, Newsletter , May 2000 (available at
www.nhrc.nic.in).
Promotional strategies directed towards the State are not limited to advice and assis-
tance. A national human rights institution might also use education and training initia-tives or information dissemination to persuade the Government and its officials toaddress economic, social and cultural rights. Government leaders, legislators and offi-cials need appropriate knowledge about economic, social and cultural rights to incor-porate a human rights perspective in planning, formulation and implementationprocesses, as well as to establish progress indicators and evaluate results. Education andtraining of State officials could also be directed towards assisting the State to meet itsinternational obligations. The strategies chosen will depend on the national context,the human rights issues at stake and the resources available to the national humanrights institution. Using a variety of strategies and activities will better promote Staterecognition of and compliance with economic, social and cultural rights.
The general comments of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights pro-
vide an outline or guide to national human rights institutions for the content of eco-nomic, social and cultural rights promotional initiatives with the State. GeneralComment No. 3, for example, re-emphasizes the importance and appropriateness ofthe State taking steps to address economic, social and cultural rights through legisla-tive and other measures and interprets State obligations under the Covenant as includ-ing “minimum core” obligations. General Comment No. 9 addresses the State’sobligation to ensure that the Covenant is appropriately recognized in domestic law, thatmeans of redress and remedies are available and that the State is held accountable.Several other general comments will also be relevant to a national human rights insti-tution if its promotional activities are focused on specific rights, such as health or edu-cation, or concern particularly marginalized groups, such as older persons or personswith disabilities.
A national human rights institution must target the State in its promotional activities,
but it can do so in conjunction with other agencies and groups that promote and pro-tect human rights, including the judiciary, non-governmental organizations and civil so-ciety groups, the private sector, affected marginalized groups and the general public.The national institution should find ways to encourage and facilitate the involvementof others with the State on economic, social and cultural rights, particularly in the for-mulation, implementation and monitoring of social policy and legislation.
119In addi-
tion, more encompassing promotional strategies, such as awareness and mobilizationcampaigns through the public media, might be used to ensure that a broad range oforganizations and individuals engage the State on these issues.

14. Promoting the integration of economic, social and cultural rights into
the educational curriculum
The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has developed a productive work-
ing relationship with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. It is con-tributing to the development of the human rights elements of the school curriculumby commenting on draft proposals in that regard. In addition, the Commission hasentered into a partnership with the Department of Education and the five Educationand Library Boards in Northern Ireland to promote teaching in post-primary schoolson the proposed Bill of Rights. This work supplements an extensive consultationprocess undertaken with children and young people outside the formal educationsector on the Bill of Rights proposals.
The Department has also jointly published with the Commission advice for school
managers on the Human Rights Act 1998, introducing the European Convention onHuman Rights into educational policies and practice. Education, in particular underarticle 2 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention, has been prioritized by theCommission in its Strategic Plan for 2003-2006, and has been a key feature of itswork to date. The Commission facilitated a visit, and then a formal mission, toNorthern Ireland by the Special Rapporteur of the (United Nations) Commission onHuman Rights on the right to education, Katarina Tomasevski.
Promoting judicial recognition of the justiciability of economic, social and
cultural rights
Rights are justiciable when they can be invoked before, and adjudicated upon by, the
courts. Historically, courts around the world have been reluctant to deal with economic,social and cultural rights, deferring to policy makers and politicians as the rightful deci-sion takers. However, economic, social and cultural rights, like civil and political rights,are now generally considered to be justiciable.
120The Committee on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights stresses that economic, social and cultural rights are justiciable. InGeneral Comment No. 9, the Committee states , “the need to ensure justiciability is rel-evant when determining the best way to give domestic legal effect to the Covenantrights”.
121
Because of its unique status as an official but independent institution, a national humanrights institution is in a good position to promote the justiciability of economic, socialand cultural rights with the judiciary and the legal profession. Promotional activities,such as workshops, should sensitize government officials, the judiciary and the legalprofession to the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights. They might alsofocus on how the paralegal system, which offers a wider range of options for enforce-ment and remedy, might incorporate economic, social and cultural rights in mediation,alternative dispute resolution, meta-legal tactics and court action. 
A national human rights institution should develop and promote mechanisms by which
the courts might adjudicate directly upon economic, social and cultural rights.Strategies could include:

22), Circle of Rights: Economic Social and Cultural Rights Activism: A Training Resource , p. 421.

87ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN PRACTICE
15. Justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights
The justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights has long been recognized in
many countries. Courts in countries as diverse as Argentina, Canada, Finland,France, the Philippines, South Africa and many others have issued judgments incases concerning economic, social and cultural rights. In many instances, direct ref-erence was made to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights in both the arguments put forward by the petitioners and in the final deci-sions issued by the courts. In addition to national-level actions, a body of regionaljurisprudence on economic, social and cultural rights is developing, based on deci-sions of regional human rights bodies, such as the European Committee on SocialRights. 
■Highlighting existing human rights laws that are not being effectively enforced;
■Using information on the status of economic, social and cultural rights as a basisfor filing a court action;
■Deriving State obligations in relation to economic, social and cultural rightsfrom civil and political rights, especially the right to life;
■Establishing economic, social and cultural rights obligations based on theprinciple of non-discrimination under article 2 of the International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 26 of the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights;
■Establishing economic, social and cultural rights obligations based on theprinciple of the indivisibility of rights;
■Using the concept of ensuring non-regression of enjoyment of economic, socialand cultural rights;
■Using judicial protection and the guarantee of due process of law to protecteconomic, social and cultural rights, for example through judicial review ofadministrative decisions and through equal procedural guarantees;
■Using international standards and jurisprudence from other countries tointerpret vague national constitutional guarantees and laws;
■Having a national human rights institution promote “test cases” or seek directintervention in human rights cases before the courts;
■Promoting an exchange of judges and other professionals who have experiencewith economic, social and cultural rights.
A national human rights institution can also make important contributions to strength-
ening the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights by initiating, interveningin or providing amicus briefs in court cases involving economic, social and culturalrights. Many national human rights institutions have among their functions participa-tion in significant cases involving human rights issues. This function can be importantin promoting better recognition and enforcement of economic, social and culturalrights by the courts.
Promoting awareness and empowerment through public education
Not all situations of human rights abuse can be traced back to legislative inadequacies,
unfair administrative practices or flagrant violations by the State. Violations of eco-nomic, social and cultural rights also occur through the actions of private organizationsand individuals, in the workplace, in the local community and in the family, often awayfrom public scrutiny. For that reason all members of society should be made aware oftheir own personal rights and responsibilities under international and domestic law.They should be alerted to their own potential both for violating and for protecting andpromoting human rights. They should be made aware of the duties they have to oth-ers.
122
A national human rights institution can play an important role in identifying and high-lighting economic, social and cultural rights issues in all sectors of society. It can call at-tention to or directly address the need for public education or other initiatives aimed atdeveloping a culture of human rights in which violations will not occur or at least willnot be ignored
123and where respect for the inherent dignity and worth of every per-
son is paramount. Human rights education “can and should be an empoweringprocess, one that enables those who have been marginalized in the economic, social,political and cultural spheres to claim their status as full participating members of acommunity”.
124
Public education on human rights should involve the affected people. It should help acommunity discover and use all its potential for creative and constructive teamwork. Itshould facilitate individuals and communities to identify their own needs and problemsand to understand the link between the problems they face and larger systems, such asnational economic and social policies and budget allocations. Public education can alsohelp affected people and communities develop strategies for realizing the enjoyment ofeconomic, social and cultural rights by setting goals, planning and implementing ac-tions.
125
A national human rights institution must take account of the diversity of its audienceand use a variety of techniques in promoting economic, social and cultural rights withthe public. Both large and small groups will benefit from education and training initia-tives that employ creative and participatory activities, such as making use of stories, fa-bles or simulation exercises.
126Identifying and using local notions of justice and rights
will help individuals and communities relate their current and historical experiences tomodern universal human rights standards and the national context.
127
On a broader scale, popularization initiatives can be targeted at the general public us-ing television, radio, advertisements, photo/art exhibits and other artistic activities suchas puppetry or theatre. A national human rights institution might also support and col-laborate with non-governmental organizations and other civil society groups to inte-grate human rights education into community mobilization programmes. Promotingthe integration of economic, social and cultural rights into the school curriculum is a vi-tal and effective approach for reaching a broad section of society through children andyoung people. This will have both an immediate and a longer-term impact on fosteringa culture of respect for human rights.

Promoting observance of economic, social and cultural rights by non-State
actors
A national human rights institution should also promote the observance of economic,
social and cultural rights by non-State actors. Non-State actors, such as small-scale em-ployers and business people, national and transnational corporations and internationalfinancial institutions, have great effects on the enjoyment of economic, social and cul-tural rights. Some non-State actors are more important than national Governments tothese rights. A national human rights institution cannot avoid concern for their activi-ties.
The first and most immediate way to promote observance of economic, social and cul-
tural rights by non-State actors is the enactment and implementation of national lawsto prevent violations of these rights by such actors. Through its work in investigating vi-olations of economic, social and cultural rights and monitoring their observance, a na-tional human rights institution is able to identify those areas of public life where newlaws, policies and programmes are required or existing ones need change. Its promo-tional role in advising the State extends to advising on these matters.
Developing effective regulatory mechanisms for transnational corporations remains a
difficult challenge. The wealth and power of many transnational corporations eclipsethose of many States. They exercise such immense influence that they are unaccount-able in many circumstances for many of their actions and States may be unwilling orunable to attempt to regulate their activities in binding and enforceable ways.International institutions and national organizations have developed codes of conductfor transnational corporations and many industry associations have also developed vol-untary codes for their members. However, these codes remain limited, non-binding andunenforceable. 
On the basis of information obtained in its investigations and monitoring work, a na-
tional human rights institution might propose and promote the adoption of legal stan-dards capable of ensuring, at least in legal terms, that transnational corporations refrainfrom violating economic, social and cultural rights.
128Indeed, to be an effective advo-
cate for economic, social and cultural rights, the national human rights institution willneed to develop capacity to monitor the impact of non-State actors on the full realiza-tion of these rights. Human rights promotional activities should also address transna-tional corporations directly and encourage Governments to ensure that their citizensare adequately protected from non-State actors. 
Training small groups in economic, social and cultural rights
Many national human rights institutions conduct training workshops for key persons
from the Government, the military and the police, non-governmental organizations andcivil society as one of their principal forms of human rights promotion. These workshopshave the potential to inform participants about economic, social and cultural rights, tochallenge them to reflect on their own and their organization’s past performance andto encourage them to develop plans or programmes for better implementation of ob-ligations relating to economic, social and cultural rights. They also equip participants toinform others, whether by sharing the experiences and materials from the workshop orby organizing similar workshops for other staff in their organization or area.
89128The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, adopted by the General Assembly of the United
Nations in resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, states clearly in article 2.2 (b) that every Stateshould cooperate with other States in the exercise of the right of every State to regulate and supervisethe activities of transnational corporations within its jurisdiction. The Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on the question of the impunity of violators of human rights asserted in 1996 that "Statesand the international community should combine their efforts so as to contain such activities by theestablishment of legal standards capable of achieving that objective" (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/15, para. 132).
Training workshops for small groups should use the best available methodologies to en-
sure learning. A national human rights institution can draw on the knowledge and ex-perience of many organizations that have developed and conducted these kinds ofprogrammes. Some have produced handbooks for small group training workshops onhuman rights.
129
Participant-centred adult education has been found to be a particularly successfulmethodology. It is based on six principal elements:
1. Learning begins with the experience or knowledge of the participants.2. After participants share experience, they look for patterns and analyse what they
have learned and discussed.
3. To avoid being limited by the knowledge and experience of participants, new in-
formation and theory are added from outside sources (readings, resource personsand the media).
4. Participants need to practise what they have learned, exercise new skills and de-
velop strategies and plans for action.
5. Participants then need to retransmit and apply what they have learned back in their
organizations and in their daily work.
6. Reflection and evaluation are built into programme design and are carried out
throughout the entire initiative, not only at the end.
Consideration might be given to grouping participants by different knowledge levels,
opinions or perspectives, to encourage participation and learning. Where an activity isplaced in a session, what comes before and after it, what is required by the facilitatorand the participant and what learning materials will be needed are also important con-siderations.
130
Allowing time for synthesis and reflection might be helpful. Asking participants thesame questions at the beginning and end of a segment to see if their positions have al-tered might be one way of observing changes in knowledge or attitude. Discussionamong participants and facilitators at the end of an event or the day also provides in-formation on whether the programme design was effective.
131
As specific activities are identified and formulated, challenges or obstacles to their im-plementation should also be identified and accounted for. Successful initiatives will un-derstand and incorporate the needs of the target audience and respond to theirexpectations. They will also take account of evaluations of past initiatives and encour-age creativity, experimentation and evolution in design.
Organizers of training workshops must consider a number of key issues for effective in-
teraction.
132The workshop participants may need ground rules to address attendance
and punctuality, assign leaders or reporters and ensure everyone has an opportunity tospeak. Warm-up activities, including formal introductions, friendly and informal conver-sation or “icebreakers” and “energizers”, can open up individuals to be receptive tomore serious discussion or messages. Seating arrangements (for example, in a circle, arectangle or rows) and group composition (that is, diverse or with similar skills andknowledge) can affect the degree and nature of participation. Where groups are in-
90129See, for example, Training for Human Rights Trainers , Canadian Human Rights Foundation training
programme handbook, Kiev, November 1996.
130Ibid., p. 55.

(Houston, Texas, Gulf Publishing Company, 1996).
volved, facilitators will be required to implement programme agendas and guide discus-
sion. Resource persons can provide new information and theory through formal presen-tations, as well as responding to questions in their area of expertise.
The diversity of individuals in a group can pose challenges. Spokespersons, facilitators
and resource persons should consider and take account of differences, including cul-tural and ethnic backgrounds, diverse knowledge levels, desire and need for detail, mo-tivation and commitment, willingness to participate, conflicting “agendas”, thinkingpatterns, learning style preferences, occupational backgrounds and levels of responsi-bility and influence.
133A good knowledge of and sincere respect for all the individuals
in the group will help in meeting their varied needs. 
The climate or atmosphere of a promotional activity or programme has a direct effect
on the level of sharing, learning and satisfaction with the event. The physical facilitiesshould be comfortable and suited to the nature of the activity. The communicationsstyle of the spokesperson, presenter or facilitator is a key factor in setting the climate;these persons should be clear, or seek guidance, about their roles and expectations inrelation to the needs and expectations of the audience. A supportive atmosphereshould be created in which participants feel free to take risks and engage in candid dis-cussion. The time allotted for the activity needs to be well managed to ensure that allthe items on the agenda are covered. Spokespersons, presenters or facilitators shouldbe energetic, ensure everyone has an opportunity to participate, solicit feedback dur-ing and at the end of activities, make themselves available for questions and learn alongwith others.
134Discussion should be monitored to ensure that it is on track and that
participants are engaging and not merely attending.
Getting participants started with warm-up activities can lead to more intense discus-
sions by encouraging physical movement and quick thinking. Discussions in smallergroups increase involvement and learning. Brainstorming activities and interactive pre-sentations challenge participants’ thinking. Case studies and simulation exercises, inparticular, provide a practical hands-on approach for testing new knowledge and skills.More traditional formats, such as lectures or panel discussions, might still be used, butopportunity should be built in for questions and comments from the audience. The con-tent of a presentation should have continuity with more participatory-type activitiesthat precede or follow it.
Effective training initiatives should include, as part of their objectives and design, fol-
low-up activities for both the national human rights institution and the target audi-ences, in order to enhance the learning process begun during the workshop. A concretefollow-up plan will help ensure participants and organizations retain and put into prac-tice concepts and skills acquired during the activity. Knowledge, skills and values needto be transferred to other colleagues and stakeholders as well.
Participants may need encouragement to develop and implement follow-up activities,
but they can also provide valuable information on how to enhance the short- and long-term impact of their learning. Follow-up activities for the national human rights institu-tion might include:
■Regular communication with participants by mail, e-mail, fax or telephone;
■Distributing a programme evaluation report to participants, facilitators andresource persons; 
■Providing networking mechanisms or facilitating further meetings or trainingprogrammes; 
91133Training for Human Rights Trainers (note 129), p. 61.
134Ibid., pp. 66-67.
■Distributing a follow-up questionnaire to evaluate success in integrating and
applying acquired concepts and skills.
Follow-up activities for target groups and individuals might include:
■Informally sharing the new knowledge, skills and values with colleagues, friends
and family;
■Formal presentations to or training of organization staff and members,community groups, schools and other public and private sector organizations;
■Integrating acquired knowledge, skills and values into existing planning andpolicy development mechanisms, such as staff and public meetings, strategicplanning sessions, consultation, research and policy positions;
■Applying acquired knowledge, skills and values to other functions, such asmonitoring, fact finding, teaching and education, other promotional activitiesand programme and service delivery.

CONCLUSION
National human rights institutions recognize the need to develop their capacity to ad-
dress economic, social and cultural rights. This handbook has discussed:
■Key concepts relating to the legal framework of economic, social and culturalrights.
■The important role of national human rights institutions in the protection andpromotion of economic, social and cultural rights.
■The bases for effective strategies for national human rights institutions inworking with economic, social and cultural rights.
The international community has reached consensus on the key concepts relating to the
legal framework of economic, social and cultural rights:
■All human rights – civil, cultural, economic, political and social – are indivisibleand interdependent.
■Economic, social and cultural rights are fully recognized throughoutinternational human rights law, including in the International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of theChild, the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of RacialDiscrimination and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms ofDiscrimination against Women, and to some extent in most domestic legalsystems.
■Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,States are obliged to ensure the full realization of economic, social and culturalrights, but can do so progressively. However, each State has immediateobligations to “take steps” towards achieving the progressive realization ofrights “to the maximum of its available resources” and to protect againstdiscrimination.
■States also have general obligations to respect, protect and fulfil economic,social and cultural rights.
■States have minimum core obligations to ensure the immediate satisfaction of,at the very least, essential levels of each economic, social and cultural right.
■There is growing international acceptance of the justiciability of economic,social and cultural rights, including effective remedies, evident in the frequentconsideration of issues involving economic, social and cultural rights bydomestic courts in many States.
■Regressive measures by States are violations of economic, social and culturalrights, especially if they are taken deliberately or intentionally or if they are notrectified when identified.
The important role of national human rights institutions in the promotion and protec-
tion of economic, social and cultural rights is based on several premises:
■Economic, social and cultural rights are violated in all States, at least to somedegree.
■Each State is required to take further measures towards the greaterenforcement and implementation of economic, social and cultural rights.
■Each State should have an effective independent national human rightsinstitution, established and functioning on the basis of minimum internationalstandards. 
93
■To address economic, social and cultural rights effectively and with credibility, a
national human rights institution must be independent, accountable andpluralistic in membership and staff, with a broad and clearly defined mandate,appropriate powers and functions, adequate resources and competentmembers and staff who seek to work cooperatively with like-mindedorganizations and individuals in carrying out their responsibilities.
■In accordance with General Comment No. 10 of the Committee on Economic,Social and Cultural Rights, national human rights institutions “have apotentially crucial role to play in promoting and ensuring the indivisibility andinterdependence of all human rights”.
A national human rights institution’s work in the area of economic, social and cultural
rights requires a strategic approach if it is to be effective.
■A national human rights institution can integrate work for economic, social andcultural rights into its organizational processes and practices through strategicplanning, evaluation and other activities that flow from mandated functionssuch as investigations, monitoring and promotion. Integration of training acrossdifferent sections and functions of the organization can help to promote amultidisciplinary approach to addressing economic, social and cultural rights.
■A national human rights institution needs a comprehensive understanding ofState obligations in relation to economic, social and cultural rights to assist indefining entitlements and ensure compliance with the obligations. The nationalhuman rights institution will be particularly challenged to find ways to holdnon-State actors accountable for violations of economic, social and culturalrights. In addition, the national institution will require competency andwillingness to deal with economic, social and cultural rights complaints withinits jurisdiction and the necessary skills and resources to undertake relatedmonitoring and promotional activities. 
■A national human rights institution might consider encouraging or evendeveloping national plans of action for the full realization of economic, socialand cultural rights. The plans could include ratification of relevant treaties,reporting processes, measures to ensure national legislative consistency withinternational obligations, education and outreach programmes and training.The national human rights institution should identify groups whose economic,social and cultural rights are violated or at risk, benchmarks from whichmovement can be measured and targets for performance.
■In mobilizing the energy and resources of others, a national human rightsinstitution can play a catalytic role in creating conditions conducive to thesuccessful promotion, protection and enjoyment of economic, social andcultural rights. Networking and collaboration between the national humanrights institution and non-governmental organizations, civil society andgovernment organizations at the local, national, regional and internationallevels will be indispensable to the support of economic, social and culturalrights. 
■A national human rights institution might identify potential partners and evenpromote or coordinate coalitions among organizations dealing with economic,social and cultural rights. It can make joint use with them of United Nations andother international mechanisms. It can generate stronger public and politicalsupport for initiatives to address economic, social and cultural rights. Potentialpartners could include ministries with relevant responsibilities, such as foreducation and health, public institutions such as hospitals and school boards,national law commissions, bar associations, civil society and community-basedorganizations, non-governmental organizations and particularly vulnerablegroups, including the poor, children, women, refugees and indigenous people.
94
■Other democratic institutions have responsibility for and important roles in the
protection and promotion of economic, social and cultural rights, including theGovernment, the legislature, the judiciary, the police and military, civil societyorganizations, private corporations and individuals.
■A national human rights institution can advocate for the promotion andprotection of economic, social and cultural rights domestically andinternationally. 
●At the national level, the national human rights institution could conductregular education programmes and information campaigns, scrutinizeexisting laws and draft bills and propose amendments and new laws, providetechnical advice, identify national and local benchmarks and targets formeasuring the realization of rights, conduct research and inquiries, monitorcompliance, investigate specific complaints and provide reports to publicauthorities and civil society. 
●At the international level, a national human rights institution could supporta variety of initiatives, such as the adoption of an optional protocol to theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to enableindividuals to submit complaints concerning violations of the Covenant, andthe provision of information or “parallel reports” to the Committee onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights on the implementation of theCovenant.
■Participating in and delivering training on economic, social and cultural rightscan help a national human rights institution further develop the knowledge andskills of its members and staff, as well as of external groups and individuals.National-level training, for example, could train other trainers, encouragevarious organizations and institutions to work together, allow a nationalperspective to emerge and promote the integration of an economic, social andcultural rights perspective into national and local plans and initiatives of bothgovernment bodies and non-governmental organizations. Local-level trainingcan broaden the knowledge and skills of grass-roots organizations andmarginalized groups and individuals. At the same time, regional-level trainingamong neighbouring countries continues to be important for strengtheningpartnerships and sharing and learning from the experience of others.
The purpose of this handbook has been to assist and encourage national human rights
institutions in their work of investigating violations of economic, social and culturalrights, monitoring the performance of obligations relating to these rights and promot-ing these rights, and to seek to make their work more effective so that all people canfully enjoy all the human rights to which they are entitled.

on an advisory basis either at the request of the authorities concerned or through theexercise of its power to hear a matter without higher referral, opinions, recommenda-tions, proposals and reports on any matters concerning the promotion and protectionof human rights; the national institution may decide to publicize them; these opinions,recommendations, proposals and reports, as well as any prerogative of the national in-stitution, shall relate to the following areas: 
(a) ii (i) Any legislative or administrative provisions, as well as provisions re-
lating to judicial organizations, intended to preserve and extend theprotection of human rights; in that connection, the national institu-tion shall examine the legislation and administrative provisions inforce, as well as bills and proposals, and shall make such recommen-dations as it deems appropriate in order to ensure that these provi-sions conform to the fundamental principles of human rights; itshall, if necessary, recommend the adoption of new legislation, theamendment of legislation in force and the adoption or amendmentof administrative measures;

whether by means of an election or otherwise, shall be established in accordance witha procedure which affords all necessary guarantees to ensure the pluralist representa-tion of the social forces (of civilian society) involved in the promotion and protection ofhuman rights, particularly by powers which will enable effective cooperation to be es-tablished with, or through the presence of, representatives of:

3. In order to ensure a stable mandate for the members of the national institution,
without which there can be no real independence, their appointment shall be effectedby an official act which shall establish the specific duration of the mandate. This man-date may be renewable, provided that the pluralism of the institution’s membership isensured.
Methods of operation
Within the framework of its operation, the national institution shall:

sary for assessing situations falling within its competence;

izations in expanding the work of the national institutions, develop relations with thenon-governmental organizations devoted to promoting and protecting human rights,to economic and social development, to combating racism, to protecting particularlyvulnerable groups (especially children, migrant workers, refugees, physically and men-tally disabled persons) or to specialized areas.
Additional principles concerning the status of commissions
with quasi-jurisdictional competence
A national institution may be authorized to hear and consider complaints and petitions
concerning individual situations. Cases may be brought before it by individuals, theirrepresentatives, third parties, non-governmental organizations, associations of tradeunions or any other representative organizations. In such circumstances, and withoutprejudice to the principles stated above concerning the other powers of the commis-sions, the functions entrusted to them may be based on the following principles:
(a) Seeking an amicable settlement through conciliation or, within the limits
prescribed by the law, through binding decisions or, where necessary, on the basis ofconfidentiality;
(b) Informing the party who filed the petition of his rights, in particular the
remedies available to him, and promoting his access to them;
(c) Hearing any complaints or petitions or transmitting them to any other

1. Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant obligates each State party “to take 
steps ... with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the [Covenant]rights ... by all appropriate means”. The Committee notes that one such means,through which important steps can be taken, is the work of national institutions for thepromotion and protection of human rights. In recent years there has been a prolifera-tion of these institutions and the trend has been strongly encouraged by the GeneralAssembly and the Commission on Human Rights. The Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights has established a major programme to assist and en-courage States in relation to national institutions. 
2. These institutions range from national human rights commissions through
Ombudsman offices, public interest or other human rights “advocates”, to “defensoresdel pueblo”. In many cases, the institution has been established by the Government,enjoys an important degree of autonomy from the executive and the legislature, takesfull account of international human rights standards which are applicable to the coun-try concerned, and is mandated to perform various activities designed to promote andprotect human rights. Such institutions have been established in States with widely dif-fering legal cultures and regardless of their economic situation. 
3. The Committee notes that national institutions have a potentially crucial role to
play in promoting and ensuring the indivisibility and interdependence of all humanrights. Unfortunately, this role has too often either not been accorded to the institutionor has been neglected or given a low priority by it. It is therefore essential that full at-tention be given to economic, social and cultural rights in all of the relevant activities ofthese institutions. The following list is indicative of the types of activities that can be,and in some instances already have been, undertaken by national institutions in relationto these rights: 
(a) The promotion of educational and information programmes designed to
enhance awareness and understanding of economic, social and cultural rights, bothwithin the population at large and among particular groups such as the public service,the judiciary, the private sector and the labour movement; 
(b) The scrutinizing of existing laws and administrative acts, as well as draft
bills and other proposals, to ensure that they are consistent with the requirements ofthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
(c) Providing technical advice, or undertaking surveys in relation to economic,
social and cultural rights, including at the request of the public authorities or other ap-propriate agencies; 
(d) The identification of national-level benchmarks against which the realiza-
tion of Covenant obligations can be measured; 
(e) Conducting research and inquiries designed to ascertain the extent to
which particular economic, social and cultural rights are being realized, either withinthe State as a whole or in areas or in relation to communities of particular vulnerability; 
(f) Monitoring compliance with specific rights recognized under the
Covenant and providing reports thereon to the public authorities and civil society; and 
113
(g) Examining complaints alleging infringements of applicable economic, so-
cial and cultural rights standards within the State. 
4. The Committee calls upon States parties to ensure that the mandates accorded to
all national human rights institutions include appropriate attention to economic, socialand cultural rights and requests States parties to include details of both the mandatesand the principal relevant activities of such institutions in their reports submitted to theCommittee. 
114
Annex 4: General Comment No. 3 of the Committee on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights: The nature of states parties’ obligations
General Comment No. 3 (1990) outlines a range of principles relating to the legal
obligations established under the Covenant. Some of the most important clauses are:
4. The Committee notes that States parties have generally been conscientious in de-
tailing at least some of the legislative measures that they have taken in this regard. Itwishes to emphasize, however, that the adoption of legislative measures, as specificallyforeseen by the Covenant, is by no means exhaustive of the obligations of States par-ties. Rather, the phrase “by all appropriate means” must be given its full and naturalmeaning. While each State party must decide for itself which means are the most ap-propriate under the circumstances with respect to each of the rights, the “appropriate-ness” of the means chosen will not always be self-evident. It is therefore desirable thatStates parties’ reports should indicate not only the measures that have been taken butalso the basis on which they are considered to be the most “appropriate” under the cir-cumstances. However, the ultimate determination as to whether all appropriate meas-ures have been taken remains one for the Committee to make.
5. Among the measures which might be considered appropriate, in addition to legis-
lation, is the provision of judicial remedies with respect to rights which may, in accor-dance with the national legal system, be considered justiciable. The Committee notes,for example, that the enjoyment of the rights recognized, without discrimination, willoften be appropriately promoted, in part, through the provision of judicial or other ef-fective remedies. Indeed, those States parties which are also parties to the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights are already obligated (by virtue of arts. 2 (paras.1 and 3), 3 and 26) of that Covenant to ensure that any person whose rights or free-doms (including the right to equality and non-discrimination) recognized in thatCovenant are violated, “shall have an effective remedy” (art. 2 (3) (a)). In addition, thereare a number of other provisions in the International Covenant on Economic, Social andCultural Rights, including articles 3, 7 (a) (i), 8, 10 (3), 13 (2) (a), (3) and (4) and 15 (3)which would seem to be capable of immediate application by judicial and other organsin many national legal systems. Any suggestion that the provisions indicated are inher-ently non-self-executing would seem to be difficult to sustain.
6. Where specific policies aimed directly at the realization of the rights recognized in
the Covenant have been adopted in legislative form, the Committee would wish to beinformed, inter alia, as to whether such laws create any right of action on behalf of in-dividuals or groups who feel that their rights are not being fully realized. In cases whereconstitutional recognition has been accorded to specific economic, social and culturalrights, or where the provisions of the Covenant have been incorporated directly into na-tional law, the Committee would wish to receive information as to the extent to whichthese rights are considered to be justiciable (i.e. able to be invoked before the courts).The Committee would also wish to receive specific information as to any instances inwhich existing constitutional provisions relating to economic, social and cultural rightshave been weakened or significantly changed.
9. The principal obligation of result reflected in article 2 (1) is to take steps “with a
view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized” in theCovenant. The term “progressive realization” is often used to describe the intent of thisphrase. The concept of progressive realization constitutes a recognition of the fact thatfull realization of all economic, social and cultural rights will generally not be able to beachieved in a short period of time. In this sense the obligation differs significantly fromthat contained in article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
115
which embodies an immediate obligation to respect and ensure all of the relevant
rights. Nevertheless, the fact that realization over time, or in other words progressively,is foreseen under the Covenant should not be misinterpreted as depriving the obliga-tion of all meaningful content. It is on the one hand a necessary flexible device, reflect-ing the realities of the real world and the difficulties involved for any country in ensuringfull realization of economic, social and cultural rights. On the other hand, the phrasemust be read in the light of the overall objective, indeed the raison d’être, of theCovenant, which is to establish clear obligations for States parties in respect of the fullrealization of the rights in question. It thus imposes an obligation to move as expedi-tiously and effectively as possible towards that goal. Moreover, any deliberately retro-gressive measures in that regard would require the most careful consideration andwould need to be fully justified by reference to the totality of the rights provided for inthe Covenant and in the context of the full use of the maximum available resources.
10. On the basis of the extensive experience gained by the Committee, as well as by
the body that preceded it, over a period of more than a decade of examining States par-ties’ reports, the Committee is of the view that a minimum core obligation to ensurethe satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights is in-cumbent upon every State party. Thus, for example, a State party in which any signifi-cant number of individuals is deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primaryhealth care, of basic shelter and housing, or of the most basic forms of education is,prima facie, failing to discharge its obligations under the Covenant. If the Covenantwere to be read in such a way as not to establish such a minimum core obligation, itwould be largely deprived of its raison d’être. By the same token, it must be noted thatany assessment as to whether a State has discharged its minimum core obligation mustalso take account of resource constraints applying within the country concerned. Article2 (1) obligates each State party to take the necessary steps “to the maximum of its avail-able resources”. In order for a State party to be able to attribute its failure to meet atleast its minimum core obligations to a lack of available resources it must demonstratethat every effort has been made to use all resources that are at its disposition in an ef-fort to satisfy, as a matter of priority, those minimum obligations.
11. The Committee wishes to emphasize, however, that even where the available re-
sources are demonstrably inadequate, the obligation remains for a State party to striveto ensure the widest possible enjoyment of the relevant rights under the prevailing cir-cumstances. Moreover, the obligations to monitor the extent of the realization, or moreespecially of the non-realization, of economic, social and cultural rights, and to devisestrategies and programmes for their promotion, are not in any way eliminated as a re-sult of resource constraints. The Committee has already dealt with these issues in itsGeneral Comment No.1 (1989).
12. Similarly, the Committee underlines the fact that even in times of severe resource
constraints whether caused by a process of adjustment, of economic recession, or byother factors the vulnerable members of society can and indeed must be protected bythe adoption of relatively low-cost targeted programmes. …

Annex 5: The Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights
I. The significance of economic, social and cultural rights 
1. Since the Limburg Principles were adopted in 1986, the economic and social con-
ditions have declined at alarming rates for over 1.6 billion people, while they have ad-vanced also at a dramatic pace for more than a quarter of the world’s population. Thegap between rich and poor has doubled in the last three decades, with the poorest fifthof the world’s population receiving 1.4 per cent of the global income and the richestfifth 85 per cent. The impact of these disparities on the lives of people—especially thepoor—is dramatic and renders the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights il-lusory for a significant portion of humanity. 
2. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a trend in all regions of the world
to reduce the role of the State and to rely on the market to resolve problems of humanwelfare, often in response to conditions generated by international and national finan-cial markets and institutions and in an effort to attract investments from the multi-national enterprises whose wealth and power exceed that of many States. It is nolonger taken for granted that the realization of economic, social and cultural rights de-pends significantly on action by the State, although, as a matter of international law,the State remains ultimately responsible for guaranteeing the realization of these rights.While the challenge of addressing violations of economic, social and cultural rights isrendered more complicated by these trends, it is more urgent than ever to take theserights seriously and, therefore, to deal with the accountability of Governments for fail-ure to meet their obligations in this area.
3. There have also been significant legal developments enhancing economic, social
and cultural rights since 1986, including the emerging jurisprudence of the Committeeon Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the adoption of instruments, such as therevised European Social Charter of 1996 and the Additional Protocol to the EuropeanCharter Providing for a System of Collective Complaints, and the San Salvador Protocolto the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social andCultural Rights of 1988. Governments have made firm commitments to address moreeffectively economic, social and cultural rights within the framework of seven UnitedNations world summit conferences (1992-1996). Moreover, the potential exists for im-proved accountability for violations of economic, social and cultural rights through theproposed optional protocols to the International Covenant on Economic, Social andCultural Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discriminationagainst Women. Significant developments within national civil society movements andregional and international NGOs in the field of economic, social and cultural rights havetaken place.
4. It is now undisputed that all human rights are indivisible, interdependent, inter-
related and of equal importance for human dignity. Therefore, States are as responsiblefor violations of economic, social and cultural rights as they are for violations of civil andpolitical rights. 
5. As in the case of civil and political rights, the failure by a State party to comply with
a treaty obligation concerning economic, social and cultural rights is, under interna-tional law, a violation of that treaty. Building upon the Limburg Principles, the consid-erations below relate primarily to the International Covenant on Economic, Social andCultural Rights (hereinafter “the Covenant”). They are equally relevant, however, to theinterpretation and application of other norms of international and domestic law in thefield of economic, social and cultural rights. 
117
II. The meaning of violations of economic, social and cultural rights
Obligations to respect, protect and fulfil
6. Like civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights impose three dif-
ferent types of obligations on States: the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil. Fail-ure to perform any one of these three obligations constitutes a violation of such rights.The obligation to respect requires States to refrain from interfering with the enjoymentof economic, social and cultural rights. Thus, the right to housing is violated if the Stateengages in arbitrary forced evictions. The obligation to protect requires States to pre-vent violations of such rights by third parties. Thus, the failure to ensure that private em-ployers comply with basic labour standards may amount to a violation of the right towork or the right to just and favourable conditions of work. The obligation to fulfil re-quires States to take appropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial andother measures towards the full realization of such rights. Thus, the failure of States toprovide essential primary health care to those in need may amount to a violation.
Obligations of conduct and of result
7. The obligations to respect, protect and fulfil each contain elements of obligation
of conduct and obligation of result. The obligation of conduct requires action reason-ably calculated to realize the enjoyment of a particular right. In the case of the right tohealth, for example, the obligation of conduct could involve the adoption and imple-mentation of a plan of action to reduce maternal mortality. The obligation of result re-quires States to achieve specific targets to satisfy a detailed substantive standard. Withrespect to the right to health, for example, the obligation of result requires the reduc-tion of maternal mortality to levels agreed at the 1994 Cairo International Conferenceon Population and Development and the 1995 Beijing Fourth World Conference onWomen.
Margin of discretion
8. As in the case of civil and political rights, States enjoy a margin of discretion in se-
lecting the means for implementing their respective obligations. State practice and theapplication of legal norms to concrete cases and situations by international treaty mon-itoring bodies as well as by domestic courts have contributed to the development ofuniversal minimum standards and the common understanding of the scope, nature andlimitation of economic, social and cultural rights. The fact that the full realization ofmost economic, social and cultural rights can only be achieved progressively, which infact also applies to most civil and political rights, does not alter the nature of the legalobligation of States which requires that certain steps be taken immediately and othersas soon as possible. Therefore, the burden is on the State to demonstrate that it is mak-ing measurable progress toward the full realization of the rights in question. The Statecannot use the “progressive realization” provisions in article 2 of the Covenant as a pre-text for non-compliance. Nor can the State justify derogations or limitations of rightsrecognized in the Covenant because of different social, religious and cultural back-grounds. 
Minimum core obligations
9. Violations of the Covenant occur when a State fails to satisfy what the Committee
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has referred to as “a minimum core obligationto ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each of therights [...]. Thus, for example, a State party in which any significant number of indivi-duals is deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health care, of basic shel-
118
ter and housing, or of the most basic forms of education is, prima facie, violating the
Covenant.”135 Such minimum core obligations apply irrespective of the availability ofresources of the country concerned or any other factors and difficulties.
Availability of resources
10. In many cases, compliance with such obligations may be undertaken by most
States with relative ease, and without significant resource implications. In other cases,however, full realization of the rights may depend upon the availability of adequate fi-nancial and material resources. Nonetheless, as established by Limburg Principles 25-28, and confirmed by the developing jurisprudence of the Committee on Economic,Social and Cultural Rights, resource scarcity does not relieve States of certain minimumobligations in respect of the implementation of economic, social and cultural rights.
State policies
11. A violation of economic, social and cultural rights occurs when a State pursues,
by action or omission, a policy or practice which deliberately contravenes or ignores ob-ligations of the Covenant, or fails to achieve the required standard of conduct or result.Furthermore, any discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, po-litical or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status with thepurpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the equal enjoyment or exercise of econ-omic, social and cultural rights constitutes a violation of the Covenant.
Gender discrimination
12. Discrimination against women in relation to the rights recognized in the
Covenant is understood in light of the standard of equality for women under theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Thatstandard requires the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women includ-ing gender discrimination arising out of social, cultural and other structural disadvan-tages.
Inability to comply
13. In determining which actions or omissions amount to a violation of an economic,
social or cultural right, it is important to distinguish the inability from the unwillingnessof a State to comply with its treaty obligations. A State claiming that it is unable to carryout its obligation for reasons beyond its control has the burden of proving that this isthe case. A temporary closure of an educational institution due to an earthquake, forinstance, would be a circumstance beyond the control of the State, while the elim-ination of a social security scheme without an adequate replacement programme couldbe an example of unwillingness by the State to fulfil its obligations. 
Violations through acts of commission
14. Violations of economic, social and cultural rights can occur through the direct ac-
tion of States or other entities insufficiently regulated by States. Examples of suchviolations include:
(a) The formal removal or suspension of legislation necessary for the contin-
ued enjoyment of an economic, social and cultural right that is currentlyenjoyed;
(b) The active denial of such rights to particular individuals or groups,
whether through legislated or enforced discrimination;
119
(c) The active support for measures adopted by third parties which are
inconsistent with economic, social and cultural rights;
(d) The adoption of legislation or policies which are manifestly incompatible
with pre-existing legal obligations relating to these rights, unless it is donewith the purpose and effect of increasing equality and improving the re-alization of economic, social and cultural rights for the most vulnerablegroups;
(e) The adoption of any deliberately retrogressive measure that reduces the
extent to which any such right is guaranteed;
(f) The calculated obstruction of, or halt to, the progressive realization of a
right protected by the Covenant, unless the State is acting within a limita-tion permitted by the Covenant or it does so due to a lack of available re-sources or force majeure;
(g) The reduction or diversion of specific public expenditure, when such re-
duction or diversion results in the non-enjoyment of such rights and is notaccompanied by adequate measures to ensure minimum subsistencerights for everyone.
Violations through acts of omission
15. Violations of economic, social, cultural rights can also occur through the omission
or failure of States to take necessary measures stemming from legal obligations.Examples of such violations include:
(a) The failure to take appropriate steps as required under the Covenant;(b) The failure to reform or repeal legislation which is manifestly inconsistent
with an obligation of the Covenant;
(c) The failure to enforce legislation or put into effect policies designed to
implement provisions of the Covenant;
(d) The failure to regulate activities of individuals or groups so as to prevent
them from violating economic, social and cultural rights;
(e) The failure to utilize the maximum of available resources towards the full
realization of the Covenant;
(f) The failure to monitor the realization of economic, social and cultural
rights, including the development and application of criteria and indica-tors for assessing compliance; 
(g) The failure to remove promptly obstacles which it is under a duty to re-
move to permit the immediate fulfilment of a right guaranteed by theCovenant;
(h) The failure to implement without delay a right which it is required by the
Covenant to provide immediately; 
(i) The failure to meet a generally accepted international minimum standard
of achievement, which is within its powers to meet;
(j) The failure of a State to take into account its international legal obligations
in the field of economic, social and cultural rights when entering intobilateral or multilateral agreements with other States, international organ-izations or multinational corporations.
120
III. Responsibility for violations
State responsibility
16. The violations referred to in section II are in principle imputable to the State within
whose jurisdiction they occur. As a consequence, the State responsible must establishmechanisms to correct such violations, including monitoring, investigation, prosecu-tion, and remedies for victims. 
Alien domination or occupation
17. Under circumstances of alien domination, deprivations of economic, social and
cultural rights may be imputable to the conduct of the State exercising effective controlover the territory in question. This is true under conditions of colonialism, other formsof alien domination and military occupation. The dominating or occupying power bearsresponsibility for violations of economic, social and cultural rights. There are alsocircumstances in which States acting in concert violate economic, social and culturalrights. 
Acts by non-State entities
18. The obligation to protect includes the State’s responsibility to ensure that private
entities or individuals, including transnational corporations over which they exercisejurisdiction, do not deprive individuals of their economic, social and cultural rights.States are responsible for violations of economic, social and cultural rights that resultfrom their failure to exercise due diligence in controlling the behaviour of such non-State actors.
Acts by international organizations
19. The obligations of States to protect economic, social and cultural rights extend
also to their participation in international organizations, where they act collectively. It isparticularly important for States to use their influence to ensure that violations do notresult from the programmes and policies of the organizations of which they are mem-bers. It is crucial for the elimination of violations of economic, social and cultural rightsfor international organizations, including international financial institutions, to correcttheir policies and practices so that they do not result in deprivation of economic, socialand cultural rights. Member States of such organizations, individually or through thegoverning bodies, as well as the secretariat and non-governmental organizationsshould encourage and generalize the trend of several such organizations to revise theirpolicies and programmes to take into account issues of economic, social and culturalrights, especially when these policies and programmes are implemented in countriesthat lack the resources to resist the pressure brought by international institutions ontheir decision-making affecting economic, social and cultural rights.
IV. Victims of violations 
Individuals and groups
20. As is the case with civil and political rights, both individuals and groups can be vic-
tims of violations of economic, social and cultural rights. Certain groups suffer dispro-portionate harm in this respect, such as lower-income groups, women, indigenous andtribal peoples, occupied populations, asylum seekers, refugees and internally displacedpersons, minorities, the elderly, children, landless peasants, persons with disabilities andthe homeless.
121
Criminal sanctions
21. Victims of violations of economic, social and cultural rights should not face crim-
inal sanctions purely because of their status as victims, for example, through laws crim-inalizing persons for being homeless. Nor should anyone be penalized for claiming theireconomic, social and cultural rights. 
V. Remedies and other responses to violations
Access to remedies
22. Any person or group who is a victim of a violation of an economic, social or cul-
tural right should have access to effective judicial or other appropriate remedies at bothnational and international levels.
Adequate reparation
23. All victims of violations of economic, social and cultural rights are entitled to ad-
equate reparation, which may take the form of restitution, compensation, rehabilita-tion and satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition.
No official sanctioning of violations
24. National judicial and other organs must ensure that any pronouncements they
may make do not result in the official sanctioning of a violation of an international ob-ligation of the State concerned. At a minimum, national judiciaries should consider therelevant provisions of international and regional human rights law as an interpretiveaide in formulating any decisions relating to violations of economic, social and culturalrights.
National institutions
25. Promotional and monitoring bodies, such as national ombudsman institutions
and human rights commissions, should address violations of economic, social and cul-tural rights as vigorously as they address violations of civil and political rights.
Domestic application of international instruments
26. The direct incorporation or application of international instruments recognizing
economic, social and cultural rights within the domestic legal order can significantly en-hance the scope and effectiveness of remedial measures and should be encouraged inall cases.
Impunity
27. States should develop effective measures to preclude the possibility of impunity
of any violation of economic, social and cultural rights and to ensure that no personwho may be responsible for violations of such rights has immunity from liability for theiractions.
Role of the legal professions
28. In order to achieve effective judicial and other remedies for victims of violations
of economic, social and cultural rights, lawyers, judges, adjudicators, bar associationsand the legal community generally should pay far greater attention to these violations
122
in the exercise of their professions, as recommended by the International Commission
of Jurists in the Bangalore Declaration and Plan of Action of 1995.
Special rapporteurs
29. In order to further strengthen international mechanisms with respect to prevent-
ing, early warning, monitoring and redressing violations of economic, social and cul-tural rights, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights should appoint thematicspecial rapporteurs in this field.
New standards
30. In order to further clarify the contents of States obligations to respect, protect and
fulfil economic, social and cultural rights, States and appropriate international bodiesshould actively pursue the adoption of new standards on specific economic, social andcultural rights, in particular the right to work, to food, to housing and to health.
Optional protocols
31. The optional protocol providing for individual and group complaints in relation to
the rights recognized in the Covenant should be adopted and ratified without delay.The proposed optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women should ensure that equal attention is paid to violationsof economic, social and cultural rights. In addition, consideration should be given to thedrafting of an optional complaints procedure under the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child.
Documenting and monitoring
32. Documenting and monitoring violations of economic, social and cultural rights
should be carried out by all relevant actors, including NGOs, national Governments andinternational organizations. It is indispensable that the relevant international organiza-tions provide the support necessary for the implementation of international instrumentsin this field. The mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rightsincludes the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights and it is essential that ef-fective steps be taken urgently and that adequate staff and financial resources be de-voted to this objective. Specialized agencies and other international organizationsworking in the economic and social spheres should also place appropriate emphasisupon economic, social and cultural rights as rights and, where they do not already doso, should contribute to efforts to respond to violations of these rights.

Annex 6: The Limburg Principles on the Implementation
of the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights
Introduction
(i) A group of distinguished experts in international law, convened by the
International Commission of Jurists, the Faculty of Law of the University of Limburg(Maastricht, the Netherlands) and the Urban Morgan Institute for Human Rights,University of Cincinnati (Ohio, United States of America), met in Maastricht from 2 to6 June 1986 to consider the nature and scope of the obligations of States parties to theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the consideration ofStates party reports by the newly constituted ECOSOC Committee on Economic, Socialand Cultural Rights, and international cooperation under Part IV of the Covenant.
(ii) The 29 participants came from Australia, the Federal Republic of Germany,
Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom,the United States of America, Yugoslavia, the United Nations Centre for Human Rights,the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Educational, Scientificand Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), theCommonwealth Secretariat, and the sponsoring organizations. Four of the participantswere members of the ECOSOC Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
(iii) The participants agreed unanimously upon the following principles which they be-
lieve reflect the present state of international law, with the exception of certain recom-mendations indicated by the use of the verb “should” instead of “shall”.
Part I. THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF STATES PARTY OBLIGATIONS
A. General observations
1. Economic, social and cultural rights are an integral part of international human
rights law. They are the subject of specific treaty obligations in various international in-struments, notably the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
2. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, together with
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol, en-tered into force in 1976. The Covenants serve to elaborate the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights: these instruments constitute the International Bill of Human Rights.
3. As human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent,
equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation, pro-motion and protection of both civil and political, and economic, social and culturalrights.
4. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (hereafter the
Covenant) should, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties(Vienna 1969), be interpreted in good faith, taking into account the object and pur-pose, the ordinary meaning, the preparatory work and the relevant practice.
5. The experience of the relevant specialized agencies as well as of United Nations
bodies and intergovernmental organizations, including the United Nations workinggroups and special rapporteurs in the field of human rights, should be taken into ac-count in the implementation of the Covenant and in monitoring States party achieve-ments.
125
6. The achievement of economic, social and cultural rights may be realized in a vari-
ety of political settings. There is no single road to their full realization. Successes andfailures have been registered in both market and non-market economies, in both cen-tralized and decentralized political structures.
7. States parties must at all times act in good faith to fulfil the obligations they have
accepted under the Covenant.
8. Although the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant is to be at-
tained progressively, the application of some rights can be made justiciable immediatelywhile other rights can become justiciable over time.
9. Non-governmental organizations can play an important role in promoting the im-
plementation of the Covenant. This role should accordingly be facilitated at the nationalas well as the international level.
10. States parties are accountable both to the international community and to their
own people for their compliance with the obligations under the Covenant.
11. A concerted national effort to invoke the full participation of all sectors of society
is, therefore, indispensable to achieving progress in realizing economic, social and cul-tural rights. Popular participation is required at all stages, including the formulation, ap-plication and review of national policies.
12. The supervision of compliance with the Covenant should be approached in a spirit
of cooperation and dialogue. To this end, in considering the reports of States parties,the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, hereinafter called “theCommittee”, should analyse the causes and factors impeding the realization of therights covered under the Covenant and, where possible, indicate solutions. This ap-proach should not preclude a finding, where the information available warrants such aconclusion, that a State party has failed to comply with its obligations under theCovenant.
13. All organs monitoring the Covenant should pay special attention to the principles
of non-discrimination and equality before the law when assessing States party com-pliance with the Covenant.
14. Given the significance for development of the progressive realization of the rights
set forth in the Covenant, particular attention should be given to measures to improvethe standard of living of the poor and other disadvantaged groups, taking into accountthat special measures may be required to protect cultural rights of indigenous peoplesand minorities.
15. Trends in international economic relations should be taken into account in assess-
ing the efforts of the international community to achieve the Covenant’s objectives.
B. Interpretative principles specifically relating to Part II of the CovenantArticle 2 (1): “to take steps ... by all appropriate means, including particularly the adop-
tion of legislation”
16. All States parties have an obligation to begin immediately to take steps towards
full realization of the rights contained in the Covenant.
17. At the national level States parties shall use all appropriate means, including leg-
islative, administrative, judicial, economic, social and educational measures, consistentwith the nature of the rights in order to fulfil their obligations under the Covenant.
126
18. Legislative measures alone are not sufficient to fulfil the obligations of the
Covenant. It should he noted, however, that article 2 (1) would often require legislativeaction to be taken in cases where existing legislation is in violation of the obligations as-sumed under the Covenant.
19. States parties shall provide for effective remedies including, where appropriate,
judicial remedies.
20. The appropriateness of the means to be applied in a particular State shall be de-
termined by that State party, and shall be subject to review by the United NationsEconomic and Social Council, with the assistance of the Committee. Such review shallbe without prejudice to the competence of the other organs established pursuant tothe Charter of the United Nations.
“to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights”
21. The obligation “to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights” requires
States parties to move as expeditiously as possible towards the realization of the rights.Under no circumstances shall this be interpreted as implying for States the right to de-ter indefinitely efforts to ensure full realization. On the contrary all States parties havethe obligation to begin immediately to take steps to fulfil their obligations under theCovenant.
22. Some obligations under the Covenant require immediate implementation in full
by all States parties, such as the prohibition of discrimination in article 2 (2) of theCovenant.
23. The obligation of progressive achievement exists independently of the increase in
resources; it requires effective use of resources available.
24. Progressive implementation can be effected not only by increasing resources, but
also by the development of societal resources necessary for the realization by everyoneof the rights recognized in the Covenant.
“to the maximum of its available resources”
25. States parties are obligated, regardless of the level of economic development, to
ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all.
26. “Its available resources” refers to both the resources within a State and those
available from the international community through international cooperation and as-sistance.
27. In determining whether adequate measures have been taken for the realization
of the rights recognized in the Covenant attention shall be paid to equitable and effec-tive use of and access to the available resources.
28. In the use of the available resources due priority shall be given to the realization
of rights recognized in the Covenant, mindful of the need to assure to everyone the sat-isfaction of subsistence requirements as well as the provision of essential services.
“individually and through international assistance and cooperation especially economic
and technical”
29. International cooperation and assistance pursuant to the Charter of the United
Nations (arts. 55 and 56) and the Covenant shall have in view as a matter of priority the
127
realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, economic, social and cul-
tural as well as civil and political.
30. International cooperation and assistance must be directed towards the establish-
ment of a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth inthe Covenant can be fully realized ( cf. art. 28, Universal Declaration of Human Rights).
31. Irrespective of differences in their political, economic and social systems, States
shall cooperate with one another to promote international social, economic and cul-tural progress, in particular the economic growth of developing countries, free fromdiscrimination based on such differences.
32. States parties shall take steps by international means to assist and cooperate in
the realization of the rights recognized by the Covenant.
33. International cooperation and assistance shall be based on the sovereign equality
of States and be aimed at the realization of the rights contained in the Covenant.
34. In undertaking international cooperation and assistance pursuant to article 2 (1)
the role of international organizations and the contribution of non-governmental or-ganizations shall be kept in mind.
Article 2 (2): Non-discrimination
35. Article 2 (2) calls for immediate application and involves an explicit guarantee on
behalf of the States parties. It should, therefore, be made subject to judicial review andother recourse procedures.
36. The grounds of discrimination mentioned in article 2 (2) are not exhaustive.37. Upon becoming a party to the Covenant States shall eliminate de jure discrimina-
tion by abolishing without delay any discriminatory laws, regulations and practices (in-cluding acts of omission as well as commission) affecting the enjoyment of economic,social and cultural rights.
38. De facto discrimination occurring as a result of the unequal enjoyment of eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights, on account of a lack of resources or otherwise, shouldbe brought to an end as speedily as possible.
39. Special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement
of certain groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in orderto ensure to such groups or individuals equal enjoyment of economic, social and cul-tural rights shall not be deemed discrimination, provided, however, that such measuresdo not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate rights for differentgroups and that such measures shall not be continued after their intended objectiveshave been achieved.
40. Article 2 (2) demands from States parties that they prohibit private persons and
bodies from practising discrimination in any field of public life.
41. In the application of article 2 (2) due regard should be paid to all relevant inter-
national instruments including the Declaration and International Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as well as to the activities of the super-visory committee (CERD) under the said Convention.
Article 2 (3): Non-nationals in developing countries
42. As a general rule the Covenant applies equally to nationals and non-nationals.
128
43. The purpose of article 2 (3) was to end the domination of certain economic
groups of non-nationals during colonial times. In the light of this the exception in arti-cle 2 (3) should be interpreted narrowly.
44. This narrow interpretation of article 2 (3) refers in particular to the notion of eco-
nomic rights and to the notion of developing countries. The latter notion refers to thosecountries which have gained independence and which fall within the appropriateUnited Nations classifications of developing countries.
Article 3: Equal rights for men and women
45. In the application of article 3 due regard should be paid to the Declaration and
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and otherrelevant instruments and the activities of the supervisory committee (CEDAW) underthe said Convention.
Article 4: Limitations
46. Article 4 was primarily intended to be protective of the rights of individuals rather
than permissive of the imposition of limitations by the State.
47. The article was not meant to introduce limitations on rights affecting the subsis-
tence or survival of the individual or integrity of the person.
“determined by law”
48. No limitation on the exercise of economic, social and cultural rights shall be made
unless provided for by national law of general application which is consistent with theCovenant and is in force at the time the limitation is applied.
49. Laws imposing limitations on the exercise of economic, social and cultural rights
shall not be arbitrary or unreasonable or discriminatory.
50. Legal rules limiting the exercise of economic, social and cultural rights shall be
clear and accessible to everyone.
51. Adequate safeguards and effective remedies shall be provided by law against il-
legal or abusive imposition on application of limitations on economic, social and cul-tural rights.
“promoting the general welfare”
52. This term shall be construed to mean furthering the well-being of the people as
a whole.
“in a democratic society”
53. The expression “in a democratic society” shall be interpreted as imposing a fur-
ther restriction on the application of limitations.
54. The burden is upon a State imposing limitations to demonstrate that the limita-
tions do not impair the democratic functioning of the society.
55. While there is no single model of a democratic society, a society which recognizes
and respects the human rights set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights may be viewed as meeting this definition.
129
“compatible with the nature of these rights”
56. The restriction “compatible with the nature of these rights” requires that a limi-
tation shall not be interpreted or applied so as to jeopardize the essence of the rightconcerned.
57. Article 5 (1) underlines the fact that there is no general, implied or residual right
for a State to impose limitations beyond those which are specifically provided for in thelaw. 
None of the provisions in the law may be interpreted in such a way as to destroy “any
of the rights or freedoms recognized”. In addition article 5 is intended to ensure thatnothing in the Covenant shall be interpreted as impairing the inherent right of all peo-ples to enjoy and utilize fully and freely their natural wealth and resources.
Article 5
58. The purpose of article 5 (2) is to ensure that no provision in the Covenant shall be
interpreted to prejudice the provisions of domestic law or any bilateral or multilateraltreaties, conventions or agreements which are already in force, or may come into force,under which more favourable treatment would be accorded to the persons protected.Neither shall article 5 (2) be interpreted to restrict the exercise of any human right pro-tected to a greater extent by national or international obligations accepted by the Stateparty.
C. Interpretative principles specifically relating to Part III of the Covenant
Article 8: “prescribed by law”    
59. See the interpretative principles under the synonymous term “determined by
law” in article 4.
“necessary in a democratic society”
60. In addition to the interpretative principles listed under article 4 concerning the
phrase “in a democratic society”, article 8 imposes a greater restraint upon a State partywhich is exercising limitations on trade union rights. It requires that such a limitation isindeed necessary. The term “necessary” implies that the limitation:
(a) responds to a pressing public or social need;(b) pursues a legitimate aim; and(c) is proportional to that aim.
61. Any assessment as to the necessity of a limitation shall be based upon objective
considerations.
“national security”
62. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only
when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity orpolitical independence against force or threat of force.
63. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to pre-
vent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.
130
64. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary lim-
itations and may be invoked only when there exist adequate safeguards and effectiveremedies against abuse.
65. The systematic violation of economic, social and cultural rights undermines true
national security and may jeopardize international peace and security. A State respon-sible for such violation shall not invoke national security as a justification for measuresaimed at suppressing opposition to such violation or at perpetrating repressive practicesagainst its population.
“public order (ordre public)”
66. The expression “public order (ordre public)” as used in the Covenant may be de-
fined as the sum of rules which ensures the functioning of society or the set of funda-mental principles on which a society is founded. Respect for economic, social andcultural rights is part of public order (ordre public).
67. Public order (ordre public) shall be interpreted in the context of the purpose of the
particular economic, social and cultural rights which are limited on this ground.
68. State organs or agents responsible for the maintenance of public order (ordre
public) shall be subject to controls in the exercise of their power through the parliament,courts, or other competent independent bodies.
“rights and freedoms of others”
69. The scope of the rights and freedoms of others that may act as a limitation upon
rights in the Covenant extends beyond the rights and freedoms recognized in theCovenant.
D. Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
70. A failure by a State party to comply with an obligation contained in the Covenant
is, under international law, a violation of the Covenant.
71. In determining what amounts to a failure to comply, it must be borne in mind that
the Covenant affords to a State party a margin of discretion in selecting the means forcarrying out its objects, and that factors beyond its reasonable control may adversely af-fect its capacity to implement particular rights.
72. A State party will be in violation of the Covenant, inter alia, if:
- it fails to take a step which it is required to take by the Covenant;- it fails to remove promptly obstacles which it is under a duty to remove to per-
mit the immediate fulfilment of a right;
- it fails to implement without delay a right which it is required by the Covenant
to provide immediately;
- it wilfully fails to meet a generally accepted international minimum standard
of achievement, which is within its powers to meet;
- it applies a limitation to a right recognized in the Covenant other than in ac-
cordance with the Covenant;
- it deliberately retards or halts the progressive realization of a right, unless it is
acting within a limitation permitted by the Covenant or it does so due to a lack of avail-able resources or force majeure;
- it fails to submit reports as required under the Covenant.
131
73. In accordance with international law each State party to the Covenant has the
right to express the view that another State party is not complying with its obligationsunder the Covenant and to bring this to the attention of that State party. Any disputethat may thus arise shall be settled in accordance with the relevant rules of internationallaw relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes.
Part II. CONSIDERATION OF STATES PARTY REPORTS AND
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION UNDER PART IV OF THE COVENANT
A. Preparation and submission of reports by States parties
74. The effectiveness of the supervisory machinery provided in Part IV of the
Covenant depends largely upon the quality and timeliness of reports by States parties.Governments are therefore urged to make their reports as meaningful as possible. Forthis purpose they should develop adequate internal procedures for consultations withthe competent government departments and agencies, compilation of relevant data,training of staff, acquisition of background documentation, and consultation with rel-evant non-governmental and international institutions.
75. The preparation of reports under article 16 of the Covenant could be facilitated
by the implementation of elements of the programme of advisory services and techni-cal assistance as proposed by the chairmen of the main human rights supervisory or-gans in their 1984 report to the General Assembly (United Nations document A39/484).
76. States parties should view their reporting obligations as an opportunity for broad
public discussion on goals and policies designed to realize economic, social and culturalrights. For this purpose wide publicity should be given to the reports, if possible in draft. 
The preparation of reports should also be an occasion to review the extent to which rel-
evant national policies adequately reflect the scope and content of each right, and tospecify the means by which it is to be realized.
77. States parties are encouraged to examine the possibility of involving non-govern-
mental organizations in the preparation of their reports.
78. In reporting on legal steps taken to give effect to the Covenant, States parties
should not merely describe any relevant legislative provisions. They should specify, asappropriate, the judicial remedies, administrative procedures and other measures theyhave adopted for enforcing those rights and the practice under those remedies and pro-cedures.
79. Quantitative information should be included in States party reports in order to in-
dicate the extent to which the rights are protected in fact. Statistical information andinformation on budgetary allocations and expenditures should be presented in such away as to facilitate the assessment of the compliance with Covenant obligations. Statesparties should, where possible, adopt clearly defined targets and indicators in imple-menting the Covenant. Such targets and indicators should, as appropriate, be based oncriteria established through international cooperation in order to increase the relevanceand comparability of data submitted by States parties in their reports.
80. Where necessary, Governments should conduct or commission studies to enable
them to fill gaps in information regarding progress made and difficulties encounteredin achieving the observance of the Covenant rights.
81. State party reports should indicate the areas where more progress could be
achieved through international cooperation and suggest economic and technicalcooperation programmes that might be helpful toward that end.
132
82. In order to ensure a meaningful dialogue between the States parties and the 
organs assessing their compliance with the provisions of the Covenant, States parties should designate representatives who are fully familiar with the issues raised inthe report.
B. Role of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
83. The Committee has been entrusted with assisting the Economic and Social
Council in the substantive tasks assigned to it by the Covenant. In particular, its role isto consider States party reports and to make suggestions and recommendations of ageneral nature, including suggestions and recommendations as to fuller compliancewith the Covenant by States parties. 
The decision of the Economic and Social Council to replace its sessional working group
by a committee of independent experts should lead to a more effective supervision ofthe implementation by States parties.
84. In order to enable the Committee to discharge fully its responsibilities, the
Economic and Social Council should ensure that sufficient sessions are provided to theCommittee. 
It is imperative that the necessary staff and facilities for the effective performance of the
Committee’s functions be provided, in accordance with Economic and Social Councilresolution 1985/17.
85. In order to address the complexity of the substantive issues covered by the
Covenant, the Committee might consider delegating certain tasks to its members. Forexample, drafting groups could be established to prepare preliminary formulations orrecommendations of a general nature or summaries of the information received.Rapporteurs could be appointed to assist the work of the Committee, in particular toprepare reports on specific topics and for that purpose consult States parties, special-ized agencies and relevant experts, and to draw up proposals regarding economic andtechnical assistance projects that could help overcome difficulties States parties haveencountered in fulfilling their Covenant obligations.
86. The Committee should, pursuant to articles 22 and 23 of the Covenant, explore
with other organs of the United Nations, specialized agencies and other concerned or-ganizations, the possibilities of taking additional international measures likely to con-tribute to the progressive implementation of the Covenant.
87. The Committee should reconsider the current six-year cycle of reporting in view
of the delays which have led to simultaneous consideration of reports submitted underdifferent phases of the cycle. The Committee should also review the guidelines forStates parties to assist them in preparing reports and propose any necessary modifica-tions.
88. The Committee should consider inviting States parties to comment on selected
topics leading to a direct and sustained dialogue with the Committee.
89. The Committee should devote adequate attention to the methodological issues
involved in assessing compliance with the obligations contained in the Covenant.Reference to indicators, in so far as they may help measure progress made in theachievement of certain rights, may be useful in evaluating reports submitted under theCovenant. The Committee should take due account of the indicators selected by or inthe framework of the specialized agencies and draw upon or promote additional re-search, in consultation with the specialized agencies concerned, where gaps have beenidentified.
133
90. Whenever the Committee is not satisfied that the information provided by a State
party is adequate for a meaningful assessment of progress achieved and difficulties en-countered it should request supplementary information, specifying as necessary theprecise issues or questions it would like the State party to address.
91. In preparing its reports under Economic and Social Council resolution 1985/17,
the Committee should consider, in addition to the “summary of its consideration of thereports”, highlighting thematic issues raised during its deliberations.
C. Relations between the Committee and specialized agencies, and other
international organs
92. The establishment of the Committee should be seen as an opportunity to develop
a positive and mutually beneficial relationship between the Committee and the special-ized agencies and other international organs.
93. New arrangements under article 18 of the Covenant should be considered where
they could enhance the contribution of the specialized agencies to the work of theCommittee. Given that the working methods with regard to the implementation ofeconomic, social and cultural rights vary from one specialized agency to another, flexi-bility is appropriate in making such arrangements under article 18.
94. It is essential for the proper supervision of the implementation of the Covenant
under Part IV that a dialogue be developed between the specialized agencies and theCommittee with respect to matters of common interest. In particular, consultationsshould address the need for developing indicators for assessing compliance with theCovenant; drafting guidelines for the submission of reports by States parties; makingarrangements for submission of reports by the specialized agencies under article 18.Consideration should also be given to any relevant procedures adopted in the agencies.Participation of their representatives in meetings of the Committee would be very valu-able.
95. It would be useful if Committee members could visit specialized agencies con-
cerned, learn through personal contact about programmes of the agencies relevant tothe realization of the rights contained in the Covenant and discuss the possible areas ofcollaboration with those agencies.
96. Consultations should be initiated between the Committee and international fi-
nancial institutions and development agencies to exchange information and share ideason the distribution of available resources in relation to the realization of the rights rec-ognized in the Covenant. These exchanges should consider the impact of internationaleconomic assistance on efforts by States parties to implement the Covenant and possi-bilities of technical and economic cooperation under article 22 of the Covenant.
97. The Commission on Human Rights, in addition to its responsibilities under article
19 of the Covenant, should take into account the work of the Committee in itsconsideration of items on its agenda relating to economic, social and cultural rights.
98. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is related to
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Although most rights canclearly be delineated as falling within the framework of one or other Covenant, thereare several rights and provisions referred to in both instruments which are not suscep-tible to clear differentiation. Both Covenants moreover share common provisions andarticles. It is important that consultative arrangements be established between theCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Human Rights Committee.
99. Given the relevance of other international legal instruments to the Covenant,
early consideration should be given by the Economic and Social Council to the need for
134
developing effective consultative arrangements between the various supervisory 
bodies.
100. International and regional intergovernmental organizations concerned with the
realization of economic, social and cultural rights are urged to develop measures, as ap-propriate, to promote the implementation of the Covenant.
101. As the Committee is a subsidiary organ of the Economic and Social Council,
non-governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic andSocial Council are urged to attend and follow the meetings of the Committee and,when appropriate, to submit information in accordance with Economic and SocialCouncil resolution 1296 (XLIV).
102. The Committee should develop, in cooperation with intergovernmental organi-
zations and non-governmental organizations as well as research institutes an agreedsystem for recording, storing and making accessible case law and other interpretativematerial relating to international instruments on economic, social and cultural rights.
103. As one of the measures recommended in article 23 it is recommended that sem-
inars be held periodically to review the work of the Committee and the progress madein the realization of economic, social and cultural rights by States parties.
